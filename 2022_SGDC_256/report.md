Criminal Law – Statutory Offence – Misuse of Drugs Act

1 November 2022

### District Judge Janet Wang Lan Jee:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mohammed Nasir Bin Awi, male, aged 50 years, claimed trial to a charge under section 8(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) for an offence of drug consumption involving a specified drug, methamphetamine. At the conclusion of the trial, I rejected the accused’s defence and convicted him on the charge. I had provided the parties with my brief reasons for the conviction and indicated that full grounds would be furnished.

2       I now set out my full grounds for the conviction. At the time of writing, no appeal was filed by the accused against my order of conviction. The accused is presently in remand.

## The Charge

3       The charge was as follows:

> DAC-909858-2021

> You are charged that you, on or before 22 April 2021, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) to wit, Methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made there under and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

> And further that you had been convicted of consumption of Cannabis, a Controlled Drug, under Section 8(b) (i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2001 Rev Ed), on the 14 October 2003 in District Court 26 (DAC/45835/2003), to which you were sentenced to 1 year imprisonment, which is deemed to be a previous conviction by virtue of Section 33A(5)(a)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and which admission and conviction have not been set aside,

> And further that you, before the commission of the said offence, had been admitted to an approved institution, namely, Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Changi Prison Complex on the 7 October 2019, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under Section 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed), for consumption of Methamphetamine, a Specified Drug, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and which admission have not been set aside to date and you are thereby liable to be punished under Section 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Agreed Facts [\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

4       The accused, a drug supervisee, provided a sample of his urine during the routine urine test at Bedok Police Division Headquarters on 22 April 2021. The urine test result was positive for amphetamine.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Upon further analysis by the Health Sciences Authority (‘HSA’), the accused’s urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine, a specific drug as scheduled in the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008).[^3] The integrity of the processes involving the procurement, chain of custody and analysis of the accused’s urine sample was not challenged. The results of the HSA analysis were not disputed.

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       The case for the prosecution hinged primarily on the statutory presumption under section 22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

#### Statutory presumption relating to urine test

6       The operative presumption under section 22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act provides as follows:

> 22    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he or she is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).

The positive result from the accused’s urine tests triggered the presumption under section 22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. By the operation of the statutory presumption, the _actus reus_ of consumption and the _mens rea_ required for the offence were triggered, as held in _Vadugaiah Mahendran v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 719</span>. The accused was presumed to have consumed methamphetamine under section 22 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Accordingly, the prosecution’s case had been made out. The burden of rebutting the presumption fell on the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he had not knowingly consumed the controlled drug.

7       The prosecution called one witness, namely, the investigation officer, SSSgt Muhammad Ihsan Abdul Rahim (PW1).

#### Evidence of PW1 SSSgt Muhammad Ihsan Abdul Rahim

8       PW1 was the investigation officer assigned to the case involving the accused.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) In the course of the investigations, PW1 recorded a statement from the accused, namely, Exhibit P7. PW1 testified that CNB would not have been able to pursue further investigations regarding the allegation of consumption of ‘G water’ in the accused’s letter of representation of 1 December 2021 (Exhibit D1), due to the absence of specific leads such as the particulars of the person who had purportedly given the accused the G water.[^5] PW1 further testified that the accused was blocked by the said person on the application, ‘Grindr’.[^6] PW1 added that no further investigation was conducted pursuant to the letter of representation (Exhibit D1) as CNB was not in possession of the accused’s mobile phone.[^7]

#### Prosecution’s Submissions

9       The prosecution submitted that the accused failed to rebut the statutory presumption, as the defence involving the consumption of ‘G water’ was a fabricated afterthought. According to the prosecution, the accused failed to inform the authorities of the circumstances involving his consumption of ‘G water’ at the outset of the investigations, despite being given three opportunities to do so during the recording of his statements by the CNB officers.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) The prosecution further submitted that the accused’s defence was bare and inconsistent, owing to his vague description of the unknown person who he allegedly met on ‘Grindr’ and gave him the ‘G water’, as well as his failure to call the alleged giver as a witness for his defence.[^9]

## The Case for the Defence

#### Accused’s evidence

10     It was the defence of the accused that he did not consume any methamphetamine. He did not know why his urine was tested positive for methamphetamine on 22 April 2021 at Bedok Police Division Headquarters.

11     In testimony, the accused stated that three days prior to his urine test, he met an unknown person on ‘Grindr’ application at his workplace, where they engaged in sexual activities.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) He was given ‘G water’ by the said person and was told that it could enhance sexuality.[^11] The accused consumed the ‘G water’. It was his position that he did not know what the ‘G water’ was and had not consumed it before that occasion. The accused maintained that he did not know that the ‘G water’ he consumed contained methamphetamine. It was also his evidence that he was unable to contact the alleged giver of the ‘G water’ as the latter had blocked him on the application and his profile could no longer be viewed.[^12] The accused testified that he did not know the name, handphone number and personal details of the alleged giver. [^13]

#### Defence Submissions

12     It was the defence submission that the accused had maintained a consistent account of how he could have unknowingly consumed methamphetamine in his letter of representation of 1 December 2021 (Exhibit D1) and remained unshaken during cross-examination.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

13     The defence further contended that PW1 made no efforts to trace the sexual partner of the accused and did not conduct any further investigations into the issues raised in the accused’s letter of representations (Exhibit D1).[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) According to the defence, as a result of the prosecution’s own failure to direct investigations into the accused’s potential defence, the statutory presumption was not rebutted.[^16]

## Evaluation of the accused’s evidence

#### Analysis of ‘unknowing consumption’ defence

14     As observed by then Chief Justice Yong Pung How in _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> (“_Johnson Cheng_ ”), a cautionary approach should be adopted by the courts towards the defence of “unknowing consumption” and “spiking”, given the ubiquity of such defence in drug consumption offences. The following passage is instructive:

> 15    I had previously in _Vadugaiah Mahendran v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 719</span> held that the statutory presumption in s 22 was twofold in that proof of the primary fact by the Prosecution, _ie_ a controlled drug was found in the urine as a result of both urine tests in s 31, triggered the _actus reus_ of consumption and the _mens rea_ required for the offence. **The burden of proof hence fell upon the Defence who would have to disprove either element on a balance of probabilities. It was insufficient if the appellant merely raised a reasonable doubt.** It may be that, in most circumstances (when s 31 is read together with s 16), the Defence would find it virtually impossible to rebut the presumption of consumption and would have to rely solely upon evidence to disprove intention or knowledge of consumption. **Therein lies the reason why the defence of “spiking” and unknowingly consuming the drinks of strangers are so commonly utilised in cases of this kind. These are allegations that are extremely easy to make but which are almost impossible to debunk. Although it is not the law that a commonly-used defence will not be accepted, a judge may be obliged to approach such a defence with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence**: _PP v Hla Win_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 104</span>. In this way, importing a statutory presumption into s 22 may well have the effect of imposing a minimum degree of care upon patrons of nightclubs to be wary of sharing drinks with others.

\[Emphasis added\]

15     The accused sought to downplay his knowledge of how his urine was analysed to be positive for methamphetamine. In his statements[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) to the CNB, the accused categorically denied having consumed any controlled drugs. In his first statement recorded on 22 April 2021 (Exhibit P6), the accused stated that he did not know why his urine was tested positive for Methamphetamine. According to the accused, he did not abuse any controlled drugs. Neither did he consume any medication. In his statement recorded on 27 May 2021 (Exhibit P8), the accused maintained that he did not take any controlled drugs. The reason he gave for the positive urine test results was the consumption of a total of six Panadol Extra tablets with plain water for his toothache on 20 April 2021 and 21 April 2021.[^18] In his cautioned statement recorded subsequently on 28 May 2021 (Exhibit P7), the accused stated that he never consumed drugs like ICE and that he only consumed Panadol Extra which he bought from the supermarket. Notably, at all material times during the recording of the statements, the accused never alluded to having consumed G water, as per his evidence in court. Neither did he mention in his statements the unknown person whom he testified to have met on ‘Grindr’ and who allegedly gave him the ‘G water’ three days prior to his urine test.

16     The contemporaneity of the recording of these statements bears emphasis. The first statement, Exhibit P6, was recorded on 22 April 2021, the day on which the accused’s urine was tested positive for methamphetamine. The other statements - Exhibit P8 and Exhibit P7, were recorded shortly thereafter on 27 May 2021 and 28 May 2021 respectively. The information relating to the alleged giver of ‘G water’ was within the possession and knowledge of the accused at the material time of the recording of his statements. However, the accused failed to provide these details to the recording officers, notwithstanding the ample opportunities accorded to him.

17     By his admission, the accused had deliberately and consciously withheld the information. In testimony, the accused sought to attribute his omission to his embarrassment of furnishing the details to the recording officer.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) He claimed that as he had consumed ‘G water’ to have fun, _i.e._ sex during the fasting month, he found it hard to explain the truth to the Malay Muslim officer. His deliberate omission to inform the recorder of the same, coupled with the marked shift in his evidence in the absence of any credible explanation, demonstrated the accused’ lack of veracity. The accused’s evidence involving the alleged involvement of an unknown person who purportedly gave him the G water, was clearly a belated assertion.

18     Equally pertinent was the accused’s omission to provide relevant personal information involving the alleged giver to the CNB officers. Save for his age and physical attributes, the accused claimed not to know his name and background. Neither did he have his contact details. The absence of specific leads clearly put paid to further investigations by the CNB.

19     Even if the accused did meet the alleged person and consumed ‘G water’ from him, taken at its highest, the defence case remained tenuous as it was inconclusive whether the ‘G water’ did contain methamphetamine. It is pertinent to note that the accused had failed to produce any supporting evidence to show that ‘G water’ contained methamphetamine. By his admission, the accused had no knowledge of whether the ‘G water’ did contain methamphetamine.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) Simply put, the accused was unable to provide a credible explanation as to why his urine had contained a controlled drug. It was his bare assertion that the presence of methamphetamine in his urine was due to the ‘G water’ he had consumed. None of these claims negated the probability that the source of methamphetamine was best known to the accused all along and did not involve the ‘G water’ at all.

20     Equally questionable were the circumstances in which the accused had purportedly consumed the ‘G water’. The manner in which the accused had ostensibly befriended the unknown person on ‘Grindr’, without first establishing his personal details was highly flippant. His claim of having consumed ‘G water’, an unknown substance from a stranger without ascertaining its nature and contents, was singularly incredible. The accused displayed a lack of care which was highly incongruous with his self-professed cautious approach against consuming methamphetamine when he was due for his urine test on 22 April 2021.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) Notably, the accused agreed in cross-examination that it was not reasonable to accept and consume unknown substances from an unknown person.[^22] It was thus inconceivable how the notion of prudence had eluded the accused.

21     The credibility of the accused was further dented by the embellishment of his evidence in court. The accused testified that he had a toothache after consuming ‘G water’ and had consumed Panadol on the following day after the consumption of ‘G water’.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) However, the reason for the consumption of Panadol was never revealed to the CNB officers during the recording of all his statements. Equally relevant was the accused’s knowledge that as repeat drug offender, he would be liable to a prescribed statutory mandatory minimum imprisonment term of 5 years if he were convicted for a subsequent drug consumption offence.[^24] The motivation to make fanciful allegations and embark on the fallacious defence of unknowing consumption of controlled drug thus cannot be ruled out.

22     The defence also sought to cast doubt on the investigations by the CNB, by contending that the CNB ought to have conducted further investigations but failed to do so.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) In support of this contention, the defence referred to the authority of _Prabagaran a/l Srivijayan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 64</span> (“ _Prabagaran_ ”) , where the court examined the investigative role of the CNB in the following passage:

> 59    The CNB has to assess the value and viability of making any particular investigation in each case. **It has to make judgment calls on the usefulness of any information given to it.** It has to consider to its resources and its statutory powers of investigation. For instance, **it cannot be expected to traverse the globe to investigate merely because an accused person mentions the names of ten persons on ten different countries together with their contact numbers.**

\[Emphasis added\]

23     In my view, the present case reinforced the observation in _Prabagaran_ that it was not a mandatory obligation which fell automatically on the authorities to conduct investigations at every strand of information, even in a situation where the contact details relating to persons potentially connected to the case were provided. No information relating to the alleged giver of ‘G water’ was provided by the accused in the present case. By parity of reasoning, where the CNB was not equipped with even the basic information involving the alleged giver, any effort to conduct a proper investigation was hampered.

24     The onus of providing the relevant leads to the authorities lies on the accused, in whose possession and ownership the requisite information reposed. The accused sought to distance himself from the unknown person by claiming that he was prevented from contacting the latter on the ‘Grindr’ application. The dearth of details not only served to render his version threadbare, but also amounted to a patent attempt to thwart investigations. The accused was keenly aware that by conveniently leveraging on an unknown entity, his false claim of ‘unknowing consumption’ would not be exposed.

25     The defence further argued that the accused would be reasonably assumed to not have taken any drugs that would result in a positive drug test, as he would not have taken methamphetamine if he knew that he was going for a urine test on 22 April 2021.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) This argument in turn begged the question as to why as a drug supervisee, the accused had departed from this minimum standard of care to be wary of accepting ‘G water’, the contents of which he had no knowledge of, from a stranger. By his admission, the accused knew that ‘G water’ had sexuality enhancement effects.[^27] As observed by the court in _Johnson Cheng_ at \[15\], the importation of a statutory presumption into section 22 may well have the effect of imposing a minimum degree of care upon patrons of nightclubs to be wary of sharing drinks with others. Similarly, a minimum degree of care would apply in the present circumstances where one ought to be wary of being offered an unknown drink by an unknown person.

26     The defence relied on the case of _PP v Tan Chui Yun Joselyn_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 85</span> (“_Joselyn Tan_”) in support of the accused’s unknowing consumption defence.[^28] In that case, the offender accepted a drink from a man at a pub. She was under investigation for drug-related activities and was aware of the possibility of being subjected to a urine test. Her defence of unknowingly consumed ketamine was accepted as the court found it inconceivable that she could have knowingly consumed the controlled drug the day before her scheduled interview. The defence argued that as a drug supervisee under a urine supervision order, the accused knew that he was required to have his urine test taken on 22 April 2022, as opposed to a mere possibility of being subjected to a urine test in _Joselyn Tan_. It was thus more unlikely for the accused to have knowingly consumed methamphetamine before his routine urine test.

27     It bears noting that the circumstances presented in _Joselyn Tan_’s case were markedly different. The defence called a witness to testify in corroboration of the offender’s version that her drink had been spiked. The witness testified to the events which occurred at the pub at the material time, namely, the offender was approached and offered a drink by a man at the pub.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

28     In the present case, however, the accused’s claim of an unknown man who offered him ‘G water’ before sex was wholly unsubstantiated. No witness was called to corroborate his version of the events as described by the accused. The defence conceded that the accused had not produced any witness to support his claim of having met the alleged sexual partner before his urine test on 22 April 2021.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) Contrary to the defence submissions, the accused’s account of his encounters with the alleged sexual partner was scant of details and failed to advance his case. His claim of having met and engaged in sexual activity with the unknown person at the bin centre where he worked and at a high risk of getting caught red-handed, was simply far-fetched.[^31]

29     Unlike _Joselyn Tan_, the accused had failed to raise a reasonable doubt of having unknowingly consumed methamphetamine. This, in large part, was attributed to his failure to provide relevant personal information about the alleged giver and the circumstances involving his encounters with him, as well as his failure to produce any independent witnesses to testify in support of his defence.

## Conclusion

30     For the above reasons, I was fortified in my view that the accused’s defence of unknowing consumption of methamphetamine was unmeritorious. The accused had failed to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities and was therefore found guilty and convicted as charged.

31     I will now hear the parties on sentencing.
