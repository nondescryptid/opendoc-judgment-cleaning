Criminal Law – Section 12(2) Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, Rev Ed 2009) – Sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9161/2022/01.\]

7 November 2022

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused Company is JF Foundation Pte Ltd (“Accused Company”). The Accused Company is in the business of building construction.

2       In the course of their work at the worksite located at Punggol North Contracts 1 & 2 and Common Greens 1 & 2, Contracts No: D/094/16, Singapore, there was a fatal accident involving a worker, one Mr Tan Tek Chuan (“the Deceased”).

3       The Accused Company claimed trial to the following charge:

> _You, are charged that you, on or before 3 September 2016, in Singapore being an employer at a worksite located at Punggol North Contracts 1 & 2 and Common Greens 1 & 2, Contracts No: D/094/16, Singapore, which was a workplace within the meaning of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A Rev. Ed 2009) (“the Act”), did in contravention of Section 12(2) of the Act, fail to take, so far as was reasonably practicable, such measures as were necessary to ensure the safety and health of persons (not being your employees) who may be affected by any undertaking carried on by you at the workplace, to wit, you_

>> (_i_)     _failed to consider the risks of tremie pipe cleaning in your risk assessment, and to come up with and implement, appropriate control measures for the tremie pipe cleaning works;_

>> (_ii_)    _failed to document and implement the approved methods of cleaning the tremie pipe in the safe work procedures and method statement documents; and_

>> (_iii_)    _failed to ensure that the lifting team have adequate instructions, information and training to perform cleaning and removal of soil from the tremie pipe_

> _and these failings thereby contributed to the death of Tan Tek Chan, an employee of a subcontractor JB Foundation Pte Ltd, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 12(2) read with Section 20 of the Act, punishable under Section 50(b) of the Act._

4       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused Company guilty and convicted the Accused Company accordingly. I imposed a fine of $100,000.

5       This is an appeal brought by the Prosecution against sentence.

## Undisputed Facts of the Case

### The Parties Involved

6       Housing & Development Board (HDB) awarded the Occupier of the workplace, China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co. Pte. Ltd (“CCDC”), a contract to construct an integrated development site of Punggol Northshore district for public housing, at Punggol North Contracts 1 & 2 and Common Greens 1 & 2, Contracts No: D/094/16, Singapore. The project commenced in April 2016 and was scheduled to be completed by June 2020.

7       CCDC subcontracted the bored piling works, contiguous bored pile works, grout piles and design, installation and testing of ultimate load tests to the Accused Company. The Accused Company engaged JB Foundation (JBF) to supply operators and workers to carry out the bored piling works in accordance with the main contract drawings and specification and main-contractor requirement and in accordance with the terms of the sub-contract between the Accused Company and JBF[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

### The Accident

8       On 3 September 2016, at around 4.40pm that day, while a group of workers employed by the Accused Company and JBF was lifting a second section of a 12-metre long tremie pipe with a crawler crane, the tremie pipe dislodged from the self-locking hook and fell in the direction where the Deceased was carrying out cutting works on a metal casing for bored pile. The tremie pipe hit the upright steel casing which the Deceased was cutting and then struck the Deceased.

9       The Deceased was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital but succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead on 3 September 2016 at 6.26pm. The cause of death was certified as “multiple injuries” [\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

### Events leading to the Accident[^3]

10     At the material time, the lifting team which consisted of Rahim Md Abdur[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) \[a lifting supervisor employed by the Accused Company\], Miah Md Sabuz (PW5) \[a rigger/signal man, employed by JBF\] and Ramalingam Sudhakar (PW7) \[a crane operator employed by JBF\], was carrying out installation of rebar cage, tremie pipes and casting of a bored hole near Bock 420A on the worksite.

11     At about 4.40pm, after the first section of tremie pipe was lifted into the bored hole, the lifting team continued to lift the second section of tremie pipe from the tremie pipe storage area. After Rahim had secured the self-locking hook to the lifting point of the tremie pipe, Rahim gave instructions by using a whistle and hand signals, to PW5 Miah to lift up the tremie pipe. PW5 Miah in turn gave a signal to PW7 Ramalingam to retract the wire rope of the crane. The tremie pipe was lifted and suspended in a vertical position. PW7 Ramalingam lifted and moved the tremie pipe 2-3m away from the tremie pipe storage area.

12     At that point, PW5 Miah saw that there was soil accumulated on the tremie pipe. PW5 Miah gave a signal to PW7 Ramalingam to lower and shift the tremie pipe towards him so that he could clean the tremie pipe. Instead, PW7 Ramalingam started to “shake” the suspended tremie pipe in an up-down manner twice. The tremie pipe dislodged from the self-locking hook and fell in the direction where the Deceased was working. The tremie pipe hit the said casing and subsequently landed on the Deceased’s back[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5).

13     The accident tremie pipe weighed about 500kg and was 12 metres in length[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6).

### Points of Investigations

14     As further revealed in the agreed facts:

> (a)     CCDC had implemented a permit-to-work (PTW) system for high-risk construction work at the worksite, which included the lifting operation to hoist bored pile materials;

> (b)     CCDC, through the Accused Company, had also implemented a one-stop registration induction safety course for PW5 Miah, PW7 Ramalingam and Rahim.

> (c)     The Accused Company had conducted a Risk Assessment (RA) Revision, for the Bored Pile Installation at the workplace dated 15 Aug 2016;

> (d)     The Accused Company had a safe work procedure (SWP) for the workplace, dated 13 June 2016;

> (e)     The Accused Company had a Method Statement for Bored Piling at the workplace dated 13 June 2016; and

> (f)     The Accused Company had prepared a lifting plan for the workplace dated 17 June 2016.

### Evidence Adduced in the Course of Trial

15     In the course of trial, these key pieces of evidence were adduced:

> (a)     PW7 Ramalingam, the crane operator, admitted that he had shaken the tremie pipe immediately prior to the pipe being dislodged and falling[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) in his oral testimony in court. He had shaken the tremie pipe in an “_up and down manner_”[^8] and did it not just once, but twice[^9]. He explained that he shook the pipe to clean the soil which was within the tremie pipe;

> (b)     The Deceased, a worker deployed by JB Foundation at the worksite, was not supposed to be working at Block 420A on the day in question. Based on the permit to work for hot works, the Deceased was only allowed to work at Blocks 419B and 420C[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10). The Deceased had also chosen to carry out his work on the fateful day when he had an option to do it on Sunday[^11];

> (c)     The hook that was used to lift the tremie pipe was a self-locking hook and it was an approved lifting gear that may be used[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). On the day in question, it was affixed by Rahim[^13], the Lifting Supervisor that day. After the incident, shackles were used for lifting work instead[^14].

## Conclusion of Trial

16     On the totality of the evidence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the measures outlined in the charge were reasonably practicable and necessary to ensure the safety and health of persons who may be affected by the work carried out at the workplace. The Accused Company had failed to take these measures and their failure to do so contributed to the death of the Deceased.

17     I was satisfied that the elements of the charge against the Accused Company had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I convicted the Accused Company on the charge accordingly.

## The Appropriate Sentence

### The Prescribed Punishment

18     An offence under Section 12(2) read with Section 20 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A Rev. Ed 2009) (“WSHA”) and punishable under Section 50(b) of the Act, for a body corporate, is a fine not exceeding $500,000.

### Sentencing Framework under PP v Manta Equipment (S) Pte Ltd

19     The sentencing framework applicable to offences under section 12(2) WSHA punishable under section 50(b) of the Act, is established in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Manta Equipment (S) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 157</span> (“_Manta Equipment_”)

20     Even though _Manta Equipment_ concerned an offence under section 12(1) WSHA, the Court was clear in its indicative view that the two-stage sentencing approach as well as the benchmarks outlined in the case would be applicable to the duties under Part 4 for which contravention is under section 50(b)[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15). The offence which the Accused Company was convicted of, under section 12(2) WSHA, fell squarely within its ambit.

21     The _Manta Equipment_ two-stage sentencing approach and benchmarks to be applied are as follows[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16).

#### First Stage

22     In the first stage, the sentencing judge is to determine the level of harm and the level of culpability, in order to derive the indicative starting point according to the benchmarks set out below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.16%"><col width="20.34%"><col width="20.32%"><col width="20.36%"><col width="20.82%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Harm</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000 to $225,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$225,000 to $300,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$300,000 to $500,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$75,000 to $150,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000 to $225,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$225,000 to $300,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to $75,000</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$75,000 to $150,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150,000 to $225,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

23     At this first stage, there should be a holistic consideration of harm i.e. a consideration of both potential harm and actual harm. As for the relationship between harm and culpability, equal weight would be accorded to both harm and culpability as both are “_equally important considerations_” and neither is to be favoured over the other[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

24     In evaluating the level of harm, the factors set out in _Public Prosecutor v GS Engineering & Construction Corp_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 682</span> (“_GS Engineering_” and _MW Group Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1300</span> (“_MW Group_”) would be relevant in assessing potential harm. These include:[^18]:

> (a)     The seriousness of the harm risked;

> (b)     The likelihood of that harm arising; and

> (c)     The number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of the harm.

25     The Court further added at \[28(b)\] of _Manta Equipment_ in saying that, _“\[w\]here the harm was likely to be death or serious injury (such as paralysis or loss of a limb), the harm could be considered to be high even though it did not materialise. If death or serious injury did occur, the harm would be graded near the top end of the high range.”_

26     In terms of culpability, the Court in _Manta Equipment_ similarly agreed with the factors set out in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_, namely[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19):

> (a)     The number of breaches or failures;

> (b)     The nature of the breaches;

> (c)     The seriousness of the breaches;

> (d)     Whether the breaches were systemic or isolated; and

> (e)     Whether the breaches were intentional, rash or negligent.

#### Second Stage

27     In the second stage, the indicative starting sentence derived from the benchmarks outlined above would be calibrated according to offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors as considered in the cases of _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_.

28     As helpfully set out by the Prosecution[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20), the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors may be seen in the table below.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"><col width="50%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Aggravating Factors</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Mitigating Factors</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender had cut costs at the expense of the safety of the workers to obtain financial gain</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Deliberate concealment of the illegal nature of the activity</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Obstruction of justice</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The existence of relevant antecedents, such as whether the offender has a poor record in respect of workplace health and safety</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Falsification of documentation or licenses</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Breach of a court order</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Deliberate failure to obtain or comply with relevant licenses in to avoid scrutiny by the authorities</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender had voluntarily taken steps to remedy the breach or prevent future occurrences of similar breaches</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">A high level of cooperation with the authorities for the investigations, beyond that which is normally expected</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">A timely plea of guilt</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender has a good health and safety record</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The offender has effective health and safety procedures in place</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### Application of the Manta Equipment Sentencing Framework

#### Level of Harm

29     In this case and regrettably so, actual harm took the form of death. The failures of the Accused Company to undertake the measures outlined in the charge contributed to the death of a worker on the site. Noting that the tremie pipe was 12 metres long and weighed 500 kg, there would also have been a high degree of potential harm to the workers within the vicinity of the bored piling works when the workers were unaware of the risks involved in the cleaning of tremie pipes and/or were untrained and briefed on the proper and safe procedure of cleaning the tremie pipes[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21). It would also have been reasonable to expect several workers to be on site when bored piling works were done. There was no doubt in my mind that the level of harm in this case was high.

#### Level of Culpability

30     In respect of culpability, I assessed the level to be low. I was mindful that there were three breaches, as outlined in the charge. The breaches were for:

> (a)     failing to consider the risks of tremie pipe cleaning in your risk assessment, and to come up with and implement, appropriate control measures for the tremie pipe cleaning works;

> (b)     failing to document and implement the approved methods of cleaning the tremie pipe in the safe work procedures and method statement documents; and

> (c)     failing to ensure that the lifting team have adequate instructions, information and training to perform cleaning and removal of soil from the tremie pipe.

31     Even though there were three breaches outlined in the charge, these breaches mainly related to one specific work activity in respect of the use of tremie pipes - that of cleaning of tremie pipes. On the evidence, I found that a large part of the attendant risks with the use of tremie pipes had been considered by the Accused Company.

32     Tremie pipes were apparatus used largely in the course of bored piling works. Their use was spelt out at \[23\] of the Amended Agreed Statement of Facts. It was undisputed that apart from having a Method Statement for Bored Piling[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22), the Accused Company had conducted a Risk Assessment (RA) in respect of bored piling works at the workplace[^23] and had also considered risks involved with the installation of bored piling works[^24].

33     As highlighted by the Defence, in Exhibit PB-120 (RA, item 7, column 1b), the Accused Company had considered the work and risk of the installation of the tremie pipe. In the same RA, at column 1c, the Accused Company also recognised a potential hazard of a “_worker hit by tremie pipe_” and in column 2(a), stated the measures necessary to prevent the hazard: “_cordon off the working area, keep the safety clearance, ensure clear communication between lifting team and crane operator, no suspended load is allowed…safety helmet, safety shoes, reflective vest_.”[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

34     In my assessment of the evidence, whilst I found that the cleaning of the tremie pipes was a distinct and separate work activity from the installation of the tremie pipes (cleaning was an activity taken prior to or after its installation) which the Accused Company was obliged to address their minds to, there were several areas of risks associated with the use of tremie pipes in bored piling works which had in fact, been properly considered by the Accused Company.

35     One of the breaches described the Accused Company as “_failing to ensure that the lifting team have adequate instructions, information and training to perform cleaning and removal of soil from the tremie pipe_”. On the evidence, it was clear that a large part of the work process in bored piling works which used tremie pipes, involved lifting. Further, one of the dangers and risks involved with the cleaning of the tremie pipes come from it having to be lifted. Where lifting was concerned, I found that the Accused Company had considered the risks of lifting operations[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26). They recognised that lifting operations were high risk operations and had drawn up a lifting plan[^27] which addressed certain hazards associated with lifting. Hence, whilst the Accused Company had failed to separately consider the specific work activity of the cleaning of the tremie pipes, I found that a key aspect of the work activity involving the use of tremie pipes i.e. lifting, had been duly addressed.

36     Further, whilst I was satisfied that the Accused Company had committed the breaches relating to the specific work activity of cleaning of the tremie pipes in this incident, I could not agree with the Prosecution’s submission that these breaches were fundamental and/or arose from a systemic failure to implement adequate risk control[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28), thus enhancing the culpability of the Accused Company.

37     There was no evidence that the breaches in respect of the cleaning of tremie pipes were intentional or rash. From the documentation presented in Court, it was clear that the Accused Company had considered the risks involved with the use of tremie pipes, namely the installation of tremie pipes for bored piling work as well as the aspect of lifting which was required when tremie pipes were in use. These were key areas in respect of the use of tremie pipes at a worksite and they had been considered. The Accused Company’s negligence laid in overlooking the specific work activity of cleaning of these tremie pipes and the safety measures necessary for it, despite having considered other major areas of risks surrounding the use of tremie pipes on the worksite.

38     The breaches of the Accused Company in this case were more isolated than systemic. Prosecution submitted that the breaches pre-dated the accident and the measures outlined in the charge were not in place from the time the bored piling works started until the accident[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). This fact, whilst it may be true, could not on its own, demonstrate that the breaches of the Accused Company were systemic in the sense that it led to an inference that such breaches were pervasive in the Accused’s Company safety system. What the evidence and documentation produced in court showed was that the risks involved with the use of tremie pipes had been largely considered by the Accused Company; it was in respect of the specific activity of the cleaning of tremie pipes that they had failed to address their minds to. This was a particular part of the entire system which they had overlooked. I agreed with the Defence that the Accused Company’s breach of its duty in this instance was more of an isolated incident[^30], than a systemic one.

39     An objective evaluation of the incident which occurred on the worksite that fateful day revealed a coincidence of unfortunate events which resulted in the death of the Deceased:

> (a)     PW7 Ramalingam chose to shake the suspended tremie pipe twice, in an up-down fashion in an attempt to get rid of soil found on the tremie pipe,

> (b)     Because the mechanism used to attach the tremie pipe to the crane was not the most suitable one (even though approved for use), this led to the dislodging of the tremie pipe from the self-locking hook;

> (c)     The Deceased, who was not authorized to be working in the vicinity, happened to be there when he decided to carry out the work required of him that day instead of another day.

40     The failings of the Accused Company contributed to the death of the Deceased but were not a direct cause of it. As much as I was acutely aware that had the Accused Company analysed the risks involved with cleaning of the tremie pipes and given the requisite training and instructions to the workers, the accident might not have occurred, the fact remained that the crane operator PW7 Ramalingam’s act of shaking the pipe and the failure of the self-locking hook were the direct causes of the accident. This was accepted by the Prosecution[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31). Taking it one step further, even if the Accused company had conscientiously undertaken all the measures outlined in the charge in relation to the cleaning of tremie pipes, the fatal accident may still have happened if PW7 Ramalingam, a licensed[^32], certified[^33] and experienced crane operator of eight years, had chosen to shake the tremie pipe to clean it against instruction and training when it was suspended on a self-locking hook. Such is the “_unpredictability of human behaviour_”[^34].

41     I reiterate the clear position that had the Accused Company identified the work activity of tremie pipe cleaning, assessed the risks involved with tremie pipe cleaning and given proper instruction and training to the workers on how to clean a tremie pipe, PW7 Ramalingam may not have shaken the tremie pipe in an attempt to get rid of the soil on the tremie pipe, and the Deceased may not have died. However, the role of the Accused Company in the entire incident, whilst cannot in any way be minimized, should also not be over-stated.

42     On the unique circumstances of this case, I was satisfied that the culpability of the Accused Company was low.

#### Indicative Starting Sentence

43     Having assessed harm to be “_high_” and culpability to be “_low_”, the appropriate sentence would be in the range of $150,000 to $225,000, as provided for in the benchmarks in _Manta Equipment_. Bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of how the accident had occurred, I was of the view that the indicative starting sentence would be in the lower end of the range of sentence prescribed for this band i.e. $150,000.

#### Offender-Specific Factors

44     Moving on to the second stage of the sentencing framework, I considered the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors present in this case.

45     I did not find any aggravating factors in this case. No aggravating factors were suggested or submitted by the Prosecution. I was mindful that no discount in sentencing should be accorded as the Accused Company elected to claim trial. That said, I need only to make an observation that it was essentially the process of trial and testimony of witnesses which greatly assisted to elucidate the full facts and investigations relating to the accident.

46     As for mitigating factors, there were several, as highlighted by Defence Counsel[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35). The Accused Company was a first offender and did not have any breaches under WSHA prior to this incident; it had a good health and safety record.

47     After the incident, the Accused Company cooperated with the authorities to deal with the Stop-Work order that was issued to the worksite. The Accused Company took steps to review their risk assessment, safe work procedure and method statement. Prosecution urged the Court not to place too much weight on the post-accident measures taken by the Accused Company because they were taken in response to the Stop-Work order that was imposed. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) required the Accused Company to take all reasonably practicable steps towards ensuring the safety of workers before allowing it to resume work at the accident location[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36). The Accused Company’s representative, DW1 Tey Choon Chee candidly stated that post-accident measures were taken so that MOM would lift the Stop-Work Order and allow them to resume work[^37].

48     Be that as it may, I recognised that compliance with a Stop-Work Order issued by MOM could be approached in different ways. In some cases, it may be done in a cursory manner with a minimum level of effort - just so that works may be allowed to resume at the worksite.

49     In this case, I was satisfied that the Accused Company had taken the accident seriously and were genuine in their efforts to comply with the Stop-Work Order. From the moment the accident occurred, the Accused Company’s representative, Director[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) and General Manager[^39] (a key officer of the Accused Company) DW1 Tey Choon Chee took it upon himself to extend as much assistance as he could to the family of the Deceased. Upon hearing about the accident, he obtained the contact details of the family members and on the day itself, drove into Malaysia to personally fetch the Deceased’s wife and children to the hospital where the Deceased had been brought to, only to learn enroute that the Deceased had passed away. The very next day, he tried to make arrangements for a funeral parlour to send the Deceased’s body back to Malaysia[^40]. In the days following, the Accused Company, along with others, undertook internal investigations[^41] into the matter and an investigation report[^42] was put up in respect of the accident that had taken place.

50     I placed weight on the fact that the Accused Company had been very helpful and co-operative with the authorities during the investigation of the matter. I agreed with Defence Counsel that the importance of co-operating with the authorities could not be understated[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43). Cooperation with the authorities saves the authorities precious time and resources that would have otherwise been expanded by having to conduct potentially protracted and tedious investigations into the accident.

51     As rightly pointed out by the Defence[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44), the Court at \[46\] of _Manta Equipment_, similarly accepted the offender-company’s cooperation with the investigations, an unblemished safety record and the post-accident rectification works, as mitigating factors.

52     With these mitigating factors in play, I calibrated the fine downwards. I was of the view that a fine of $100,000 would be a fair and proportionate sentence for the Accused Company.

## Conclusion

53     At \[9\] of the Defence’s Submissions on Sentence was a quote by the Minister for Manpower, Dr Ng Eng Hen (as he then was) at the Second Reading of the Workplace Safety and Health Bill:-

> _"Even as we work with industry to build up their capabilities to improve safety and health at their workplaces, we need to ensure that the penalties for non-compliance are sufficiently high to effect a cultural change on the ground. Penalties should be set at a level that reflects the true costs of poor safety management, including the costs of disruptions and inconvenience to members of the public which workplace accidents may cause….. However, the penalty, in any given case, will be applied taking into account all the relevant circumstances, including the culpability of the offender, the potential harm that could have been caused, and the harm actually done.__[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45)"_

54     Having considered the level of harm and culpability of the Accused Company in this case, the overall circumstances as well as the mitigating factors present, I was satisfied that the fine of $100,000 imposed on the Accused Company, was a fair and just outcome in this case.

55     In a case involving a needless death of a worker at a worksite, a visceral response may sometimes be to impose an over-compensatory sentence on the Accused Company, for failing to take practicable measures which may have prevented such death. The role and culpability of the Accused Company in this entire incident which led to a death, cannot be glossed over. However, the nature of this accident reminds us that in certain situations, even a full and comprehensive set of safe work procedures which are wholly necessary, may not be sufficient to counter human error, irresponsibility and/or negligence.

56     As informed by the Prosecution, the crane operator, PW7 Ramalingam Sudhakar, was sentenced to 11 weeks’ imprisonment for an offence under section 15(3A) WSHA on 7 April 2022, for his role in the incident[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46).
