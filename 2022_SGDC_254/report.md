Criminal Law – Offences – Property – Forgery of a valuable security

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9198/2022/01.\]

31 October 2022

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Png Lee Yin, a 38-year-old female Singaporean who was acting in person, pleaded guilty to one amalgamated charge of embarking on a course of conduct of forging documents purporting to be valuable securities by forging 15 cheques valued collectively at $94,661.81 by altering the payee’s name to her name with the intention to commit fraud. She forged these 15 cheques purportedly issued by AD Design & Building Private Limited and AD Design Consultant Pte Ltd (“the companies”) between April 2021 and June 2021 when she was employed as a finance executive with AD Design & Building Private Limited (“ADDB”). She deposited the forged cheques into her personal bank account for her own use. The amalgamated charge was preferred under s 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“ PC”) pursuant to s 124(4) the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”) and punishable under s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The accused failed to make any restitution for the amount defrauded. I sentenced her to 26 months’ imprisonment. She commenced serving her sentence on the same day.

2       The accused being dissatisfied with her sentence has filed this appeal from prison.

## The charge

3       The charge against the accused read as follows:

> You, are charged that you, sometime between April 2021 and June 2021, in Singapore, did embark on a course of conduct of forging documents which purport to be valuable securities, to wit, you forged 15 cheques valued at approximately SGD$94,661.81 purportedly issued by AD Design & Building Private Limited and AD Design Consultant Pte Ltd in Singapore (“the Companies”), by altering the payee’s name on each cheque to reflect ‘Png Lee Yin’ without the Companies’ knowledge, therefore making false documents with intent to commit fraud, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, punishable under s 124(8)(a) (ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.

## The statement of facts

4       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts (“SOF”) without any qualification.

> 1.    The accused is Png Lee Yin, female 38 years old, Singapore Citizen, bearing NRIC No.: …….. During the material time, the accused was employed as a finance executive with AD Design & Building Pte Ltd (“**ADDB**”).

> **FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

> 2.    On 16 June 2021 at about 6.18 p.m., the complainant, one Go Hong Ping, the manager of ADDB, made a complaint to the Singapore Police Force. He stated that the accused, who works in the accounts department, had stolen money from the company’s account by issuing cheque into her own bank account. The incident location provided was the office of ADDB, at 28 Sin Ming Ln #08-148, Midview City, Singapore 573972.

> **FACTS RELATING TO** **_DAC-910077-2022_**

> 3.    The accused began working in ABBD in April 2021. As part of her duties as the company’s finance executive, she was to sort out the invoices from suppliers, and to prepare cheques for their payments. She would prepare cheques for her managing director, one **Zhang Jie**, to sign. These cheques would be issued in the name of either ADDB or its related company, one AD Design Consultant Pte Ltd (collectively, “**the companies**”), and were meant to be delivered to the suppliers.

> 4.    A few days after the accused joined the company, the accused designed to forge the Companies’ cheques. The accused’s _modus operandi_ was as follows:

>> (a)    The accused would prepare the companies’ cheques by filling up the payee’s name and the amount using a pen with erasable ink (“**erasable pen**”). The said cheque information would tally with the corresponding invoice;

>> (b)    She would then provide Zhang Jie the prepared cheque and the erasable pen for her signature;

>> (c)    After Zhang Jie signed the said cheque using the said erasable pen, the accused would fraudulently alter the cheque by erasing the payee’s name and replacing it with her own name. She would also erase the stated amount, and fraudulently insert an amount she desired. These would be done without the Companies’ knowledge.

>> (d)    The accused would then deposit these cheques into her personal bank account, for her own use.

> 5.    Between April 2021 and June 2021, in Singapore, the accused employed her _modus operandi_ to forge 15 of the companies’ cheques, valued at approximately SGD$94,661.81 in total, with intent to commit fraud. These cheques were all encashed into either the accused’s personal POSB bank account (account number XXX) or UOB bank account (account number XXX), and she used the sums for her own use. The said cheques are:

> 6.    Thus, between April 2021 and June 2021, in Singapore, the accused did embark on a course of conduct of forging documents which purport to be valuable securities, to wit, she forged 15 cheques valued at approximately SGD$94,661.81 purportedly issued by the companies, by altering the payee’s name on each cheque to reflect ‘Png Lee Yin’ without the companies’ knowledge, therefore making false documents with intent to commit fraud. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) which is an amalgamated charge pursuant to Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, punishable under s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.

> 7.    The accused admitted that she committed the offence out of greed. Every time she encashed a forged cheque into her personal bank account, she would use the monies for her own expenditure, which comprised mostly of online gambling. The accused admitted in investigations that she was not addicted to gambling but forging the companies’ cheques “became easy money for me when I got away with it”.

> 8.    The accused’s offence only came to light when the said Zhang Jie realised sometime in June 2021 that the companies’ account balances were falling very quickly. Having checked the account, she noticed that there were suspicious cheque payments made, and she asked the accused for the corresponding invoices. The accused delayed providing the invoices by claiming that she could not find them. In truth, there were no invoices that corresponded to the material cheque payments, because these were paid pursuant to the cheques forged by the accused.

> 9    Finally, being suspicious of the accused, on 16 June 2021, Zhang Jie informed the accused to purchase cheque images from the bank, to account for each cheque issued by the companies. The accused then admitted to Zhang Jie that she had forged the companies’ cheques and encashed them into her own bank account. The Police report at \[2\] above was made on the same day.

> 10.    The accused has made no restitution to date.

## Antecedents

5       The accused had no antecedents.

## Prescribed punishment

6       Section 467 of the Penal Code provided that an offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years and shall also be liable to fine. Since the charge was amalgamated under s 124(4) of the CPC, the enhanced punishment under s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC was applicable. S 124(8)(a)(ii) provided that the court may sentence the offender to two times the amount of punishment to which the offender would otherwise have been liable if he had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence. Under s 124(9) of the CPC, the Magistrate’s Court or District Court had the power to award the full punishment provided under subsection (8) in respect of the offence.

## Prosecution’s sentencing submissions

7       The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 28 months’ imprisonment. It pointed out that the accused had committed a serious offence of forging several cheques to defraud her employer and that her criminality was high. It highlighted several aggravating features in this case which are summarised below:

> (a)     Offence was pre-meditated.

> (b)     Sum of $94,661.81 defrauded was significant.

> (c)     The accused had abused her position in ADDB to carry out the offence.

> (d)     The offence was committed over a significant period of months.

> (e)     The accused took steps to evade detection of the offence.

## Mitigation Plea

8       The accused tendered a written mitigation plea. She admitted to her mistakes and agreed that she must accept the punishment. She regretted her actions and blamed herself for not fighting her greed. She had even entertained suicidal thoughts, but she had overcome that as she knew she had to face everything. She asked for leniency for a shorter sentence so that she could resume her current life which she managed to “strongly build up”.

9       She had been working since her arrest and during this one year, she had reminded herself countless times to reject every possibility of greed. Even when opportunities presented, she told herself that a moment of folly or greed was not worth it. She had great confidence that she could control herself and would not repeat such offences.

10     The accused enclosed a letter from her employer for the past one year. Her employer, SMS Marine Pte Ltd, stated that the accused came forward with her offences and had shown dedication and used her actions to prove she was remorseful. She had not attempted any forms of unlawful practices during her course of duty. Her employer requested for a lenient jail sentence for the accused as it would put her family in severe difficulty and create downtime for the company as she held an important position in dealing with “heavy HR daily duties”.

## The court’s decision

### Deterrence

11     In my view, given the gravity and nature of the offence committed which entailed the use of cheques, a financial instrument, the dominant sentencing objective in this case must be one of deterrence: _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> at \[49\]. Further, s 467 of the PC carried a mandatory jail term of up to 15 years along with a discretionary fine. By virtue of s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC, the accused was also liable for enhanced punishment of twice the penalty provided for under s 467 of the PC.

### Aggravating factors

12     In sentencing the accused, I took into account the following aggravating factors including the ones highlighted by the Prosecution:

> (a)     The accused hatched her fraudulent forgery scheme a mere few days after she joined ADDB[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). She was meticulous to use an erasable pen for the payee’s name and amount so that she could subsequently alter the details. She took care to ensure that the cheque information matched the corresponding invoice so that her managing director would not raise any queries. She even provided her managing director the erasable pen for signing on the cheques presumably to make the cheques look consistent. The offence was clearly pre-meditated and carefully executed.

> (b)     The accused had abused her position in ADDB as a finance executive. She was responsible to keep proper accounts and issue correct cheque payments to the suppliers. Instead, she had breached her duties and the trust her employer had placed in her by doctoring the cheques and channelling the funds to herself.

> (c)     As a general principle, in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence. The economic value is a proxy for the degree of criminal benefit received by the offender and the degree of harm caused to the victim: _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> (“_Anne Gan_”) at \[42\]. Here, the accused defrauded close to $100,000 ($94,661.81) which was a significant sum. She had thereby caused substantial harm in direct financial losses to the companies for which there was no restitution.

> (d)     The accused committed the offence over a period of three months from the time she joined ADDB in April 2021 to June 2021. She brazenly forged seven cheques in her first month of work, six cheques in her second month and two cheques in June 2021, her third month. She ended her deceitful conduct in June 2021 not because she was overcome with remorse, but because she knew that her managing director was onto her trail. The managing director had observed that the companies’ account balances were dwindling quickly and upon checking the accounts, had noticed suspicious cheque payments and asked the accused for the invoices. The chronological order of the 15 forged cheques is set out below.

> (e)     The accused was motivated by greed[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). She spent the huge sum of money she obtained all on herself most of which was incurred on online gambling. While she denied being a gambling addict, she admitted that forging the companies’ cheques became easy money for her.

> (f)     Despite knowing that her game was up, the accused chose not to come clean with her managing director at the earliest chance. Conversely, she tried to evade discovery of her criminal deeds by giving excuses that she could not find the invoices. She was fully aware that there were no corresponding invoices to the payments for the cheques she had forged. It was finally on 16 June 2021, when her managing director who was suspicious of the accused told her to purchase cheque images from the bank to account for each cheque issued by the companies that the accused admitted to her deeds.

> (g)     Although the accused had no prior antecedents, she could not be said to be a first offender having regard to the 15 instances of forged cheques in this case: _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[14\]-\[15\]. I agreed with the Prosecution that it demonstrated her persistence in offending, and her disregard for the financial security of her victim, her employer[^4].

### Mitigating factors

13     In sentencing the accused, I gave due weight to her early plea of guilt which had saved the State precious time and resources. As regards the “severe difficulty" her family would have to suffer and the disruption her current employer would have to bear arising from her incarceration (see \[10\] above\]), it is settled law that other than in very exceptional, extreme, or rare circumstances, hardship to the offender’s family or employer for that matter, has very little, if any mitigating value: _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[10\] to \[11\]. There were no exceptional circumstances in this case.

### Precedents

14     In urging the court to impose a sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment, the Prosecution had relied on two reported precedents under s 467 of the PC[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). The precedents are summarised below.

The District Court imposed 26 months’ imprisonment for each of the unamalgamated forgery charges involving $100,000.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

15     In respect of _Wong Huey Min_, the Prosecution emphasized that 16 months’ imprisonment was imposed for individual unamalgamated charges involving amounts around $50,000 whereas the present case involved an amalgamated charge pertaining to 15 forged cheques for a much bigger sum. The Prosecution referred to the decision of Justice Vincent Hoong in _Azman bin Mustaffah v Public Prosecutor_ (MA 9220/2021/01) (“_Azman_”) to submit that based on the fact of amalgamation alone, an uplift must be applied from the sentencing position in _Wong Huey Min__[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)_.

16     There were no issued grounds of decision for _Azman_. In this regard, I noted that Justice Hoong held in _PP v Song Hauming Oskar_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 965</span> at \[69\] that “the device of amalgamation is not merely administrative or procedural in nature. Instead, amalgamation can be used to signal the higher criminality of the accused and the gravity of the course of criminal conduct”.

17     The Prosecution cited _Tan Keat Siang_ where the District Court endorsed a proposed sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment in relation to defrauded amounts between $90,000 and $99,999 for an individual forgery charge to argue for a further uplift in the sentence[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). As such, it submitted that the sentence in this case should be at least 28 months’ imprisonment.

18     Having reviewed the precedents, I noted where the offender was untraced or had no relevant antecedents and no restitution or only partial restitution was made, the sentencing range was between 24 months to 26 months’ imprisonment for defrauded amounts between $90,000 to $100,000. I was mindful that these precedents were in respect of unamalgamated charges unlike the present case. Nonetheless, the amount involved remained the main consideration in sentencing for property offences: _Anne Gan_.

19     After considering the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case and having regard to the precedents, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence in this case would be 26 months’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

20     For the foregoing reasons, I sentenced the accused to 26 months’ imprisonment. In my view, the sentence was fair and just.
