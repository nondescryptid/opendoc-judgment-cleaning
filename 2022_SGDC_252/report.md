Civil Procedure – Jurisdiction – State Courts Act 1970 – District Court limit

Civil Procedure – Costs – Principles

28 October 2022 - Judgment Reserved

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       The current monetary limit to the general civil jurisdiction of the District Court is $250,000: see Section 19(4) read with Section 2 of the State Courts Act 1970 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “**SCA**”). Does this include interests and costs which may be awarded by the court at the end of proceedings? Surprisingly, it appears that this question has not been directly addressed before.

2       The question arose before me. After considering the parties’ submissions, I answered it in the negative. These are my reasons.

## Background

3       District Court Suit No 1224 of 2019 (“**Suit 1224**”) is the Plaintiff’s claim for damages for injuries he sustained from a road traffic accident in 2017. Consent interlocutory judgment was entered in the Plaintiff’s favour in November 2019, for the Defendant to bear 85% of the damages to be assessed.

4       The assessment of damages proceedings (the “**AD Proceedings**”) took place before me on 29 November 2021 and 9 March 2022. Written submissions were filed by parties between June and July 2022. On 10 August 2022, I delivered my oral decision in the AD Proceedings. That decision was further clarified on 25 August 2022 to correct some calculation errors. At the end of the hearing on 25 August 2022, I gave the following orders and directions:

> (a)     The total damages assessed (at 100%) was $357,873.20. This included damages of $114,000 which was agreed between the parties. A breakdown of the damages assessed (including those agreed) is set out at **Annex A**.

> (b)     Pursuant to the interlocutory judgment, the damages payable by the Defendant is 85% of the damages assessed. This worked out to be $304,192.20.

> (c)     Since the monetary limit on the District Court’s jurisdiction is $250,000 and the Plaintiff has confirmed both in the course of the AD Proceedings and in closing written submissions that he would abandon the excess above such limit, the amount payable to the Plaintiff by the Defendant is limited to $250,000.

> (d)     Parties were directed to file sequential written submissions on interest and costs. These submissions should address whether the monetary limit on the District Court’s general jurisdiction included or excluded interest and costs. With parties’ agreement, the issue of interest and costs will be decided by me by way of a documents-only hearing based on these written submissions.

> (e)     The time for appeal against my decision in the AD Proceedings be deferred until decision on interest and costs is given.

5       Pursuant to these directions, parties filed written submissions addressing the issues of interest and costs on 31 August 2022, 12 and 19 September 2022. Subsequently, I directed parties to address certain additional issues and supplemental written submissions were filed on 19 and 26 October 2022. I now give my decision based on these submissions. To be clear, this decision concerns only the issues of interest and costs to be awarded to the Plaintiff in Suit 1224.

## Issues and Parties’ Positions

### Issues

6       There are two broad issues for my determination:

> (a)      **Issue 1**: Whether the $250,000 monetary limit on the District Court’s general civil jurisdiction in Section 19(4) read with Section 2 of the SCA (the “**DC Monetary Limit**”) includes or excludes the elements of interest and costs. This is a preliminary issue that must be decided first.

> (b)      **Issue 2**: If the DC Monetary Limit _excludes_ the elements of interest and costs, then what is the appropriate quantum of costs and interest to be awarded to the Plaintiff.

7       I set out parties’ respective positions on each of the two issues.

### Issue 1: Jurisdiction

#### Plaintiff’s position

8       The Plaintiff’s position is that the DC Monetary Limit _excluded_ non-contractual interest and costs. In other words, non-contractual interest and costs may be awarded in _addition_ to the maximum sum of $250,000 allowable as damages, such that the aggregate sum payable to the Plaintiff would exceed $250,000. I shall refer to this as the “**Exclusive Interpretation**”.

9       In support of this position, the Plaintiff cited the case _Abdul Rahman bin Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 138</span> (“**_Abdul Rahman_**”).[^1] I will elaborate on the case further (at \[21\] to \[23\] below) but in essence, the High Court in _Abdul Rahman_ held that the phrase “_the amount in dispute or value of the subject-matter_” in Section 21(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (the “**SCJA 1999**”) did _not_ include interest and costs, and suggested that Section 20(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 1999 Ed) (the “**SCA 1999**”) should be interpreted the same way.

#### Defendant’s position

10     The Defendant disagreed that the decision in _Abdul Rahman_ is useful or relevant. This is because Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 (which was considered in _Abdul Rahman_) has since been repealed and the current Section 19(4)(a) of the SCA is worded differently.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) In particular, Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 referred to “_debt, demand or damaged claimed_” not exceeding the District Court limit, whereas Section 19(4)(a) of the SCA refers to “_the amount claimed in the action_” not exceeding the District Court limit.[^3]

11     On that basis, the Defendant submitted that the phrase “_the amount claimed in the action_” (used in Section 19(4)(a) of the SCA) must be read to _include_ interest, and costs in a tortious action.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) I shall refer to this as “**Inclusive Interpretation**”.

### Issue 2: Quantum

#### Plaintiff’s position

12     The Plaintiff’s submissions on Issue 2 are as follows:

> (a)     On interest:

>> (i)       No interest is payable on future expenses, loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

>> (ii)       The Plaintiff is entitled to pre-judgment interest at the rate of 2.67% per annum on the sum of $97,678 (being the sum assessed as special damages) from the date of the accident (i.e. 1 April 2017) to 28 February 2021, being the date of the first interim payment of $50,000 (a further subsequent interim payment of $50,000 was made on 15 March 2022, but the Plaintiff was content to adopt the first payment date for computation of interest).[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

>> (iii)       The Plaintiff is entitled to pre-judgment at the rate of 5.33% per annum on the sum of $52,105 (being the sum assessed as general damages for pain and suffering) from the date of the writ (i.e. 24 April 2019) to 28 February 2021.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

>> (iv)       The Plaintiff is entitled to pre-judgment at the rate of 5.33% per annum on the sum of $49,753 (being the sum assessed as general damages for pain and suffering less the sum of $2,352) from 29 February 2021 to the date of judgment (i.e. 25 August 2022).[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> (b)     On costs, the Plaintiff submitted that he should be entitled to costs fixed at $32,000 plus GST, with reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

#### Defendant’s position

13     The Defendant’s position on Issue 2 can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     On interest:

>> (i)       The Defendant agreed that there should be no pre-judgment interest awarded for future losses.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

>> (ii)       In general, the Defendant agreed that interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum should apply to general damages for pain and suffering from the date of the writ to the date of judgment, less any interim payment made.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

>> (iii)       In general, the Defendant agreed that interest at the rate of 2.67% per annum should apply to special from the date of the accident to the date of judgment, less any interim payment made.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> (b)     On costs payable to the Plaintiff, the Defendant submitted the sum of $18,500 plus GST and reasonable disbursements.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

## My Decision

### Issue 1 – Jurisdiction

#### Overview of the statutory context

14     The jurisdiction of the District Court is established (and restricted) by statute, so the natural starting point is the relevant provisions of the SCA.

15     Pursuant to Section 19(4) of the SCA, the civil jurisdiction of the District Court is limited to actions where the amount claimed does not exceed the “District Court limit”:

> Subject to sections 22 and 23, **a District Court’s jurisdiction** under subsection (2) **does not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where **—

>> (a)    the **amount claimed in the action exceeds the District Court limit**; or

>> (b)    any remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.

(emphasis added)

16     The “District Court limit” is currently $250,000: see Section 2 of the SCA.

17     Notwithstanding Section 19(4) of the SCA, the District Court _can_ hear actions where the amount claimed by the claimant exceeds $250,000 _if_:

> (a)     parties so agree by a signed memorandum: see Section 23 of the SCA;

> (b)     the claimant abandons the excess amount: see Section 22 of the SCA; or

> (c)     the action was commenced in the High Court or the General Division, and subsequently transferred to the District Court pursuant to the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016.

18     It is not disputed that this case fell within the second of these scenarios.

19     Pursuant to Section 22 of the SCA, where the claimant abandons the excess amount above the District Court limit, the District Court shall “_thereupon_” have jurisdiction to hear and try the action, except that the claimant cannot in that action recover an amount exceeding the District Court limit. Section 22 of the SCA states:

> (1)    Where —

>> (a)    the amount claimed in an action exceeds the District Court limit, or any remedy or relief sought in an action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit; and

>> (b)    a District Court would have jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action if the amount or value (as the case may be) did not exceed the District Court limit,

> the claimant may abandon the excess amount or that remedy or relief, as the case may be, and thereupon a District Court has jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action, except that the claimant cannot in that action —

>> (c)    recover an amount exceeding the District Court limit; and

>> (d)    obtain any remedy or relief in respect of the subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.

> (2)    Where a District Court has jurisdiction to hear and try an action by virtue of this section, the judgment of the court in the action is a full discharge of all demands in respect of the cause of action.

#### The decision in Abdul Rahman

20     As against this statutory framework, both parties referred to the decision in _Abdul Rahman_. I should add that _Abdul Rahman_ also appears to be the only reported local decision which has touched upon the issue thus far.

21     In _Abdul Rahman_, the High Court had to decide if the applicant required leave to appeal against the decision of a District Judge after trial. This turned on the interpretation of the phrase “_the amount in dispute or value of the subject-matter_” in Section 21(1) of SCJA 1999, which read:

> Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other written law, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from a decision of a District Court or Magistrate’s Court in any suit or action for the recovery of immovable property or in any civil cause or matter where **the amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter** exceeds $50,000 or such other amount as may be specified by an order made under subsection (3) or with the leave of a District Court, a Magistrate’s Court or the High Court if under that amount.

(emphasis added)

22     The applicant in _Abdul Rahman_ argued that the “_amount in dispute_” _included_ interest and costs, and therefore he did not require leave to appeal to the High Court because the “_amount in dispute_” in that case would exceed $50,000 if interest and costs were taken into account (but not otherwise).

23     In rejecting this argument, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as His Honour then was) drew a parallel between Section 21(1) of SCJA 1999 and Section 20(1) of SCA 1999, and held that non-contractual interest and costs should _not_ be included in construing either of these provisions. This was because non-contractual interest and costs that may be awarded to a claimant are discretionary and often increase with the passage of time. It would therefore be nearly impossible for a claimant to predict with any accuracy whether his or her claim would fall within the jurisdiction of the District Court or the Magistrates’ Court (and which of the two courts) if these discretionary and fluctuating elements were included in determining the monetary jurisdiction of these courts. Such an interpretation would result in unintended uncertainty and confusion which would be intolerable for something so fundamental as a court’s jurisdiction (at \[24\] and \[25\]):

> **In my opinion, the “amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter” in s 21 does not encompass the non-contractual interest and costs** elements of a claim for a contractual amount or for damages. Interest would usually be awarded if a plaintiff is successful in his action and costs would, in the great majority of cases, follow the event. Nevertheless, they remain discretionary and, if awarded, may fluctuate in amount according to the period for which interest is given and depending on the discretion of the trial judge or the Registrar taxing the costs where the amount of costs is concerned. **If interest and costs are to be included in computing the “amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter” in s 21, then it follows that they ought to be taken into consideration also when construing jurisdictional provisions such as s 20(1) Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 1999 Ed)** which provides:

>> A District Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and try any action founded on contract or tort where —

>>> (a)    the debt, demand or damage claimed does not exceed the District Court limit, whether on balance of account or otherwise; or

>>> (b)    there is no claim for money, and the remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject-matter the value of which does not exceed the District Court limit.

> **Doing so would entail a plaintiff having to calculate the amount of interest and estimate the costs at the time of commencement of action to see whether the sum of the claim, interest and costs exceeds the monetary jurisdictional limit. With interest and costs increasing as the days pass, an action which was within the district court or the magistrates’ court limit when commenced could well breach the respective limits by the time the action is ready for trial, perhaps even during the course of the trial!** Similarly, a matter which was within the District Court’s jurisdiction when heard by the Registrar there could be beyond that jurisdiction by the time an appeal goes before the district judge in chambers. The action would then have to be transferred to the High Court for hearing. **It does not seem sensible to me to inject such uncertainties into something so fundamental as the court’s jurisdiction.**

> 25    The reasoning for reading s 21 Supreme Court of Judicature Act as excluding interest and costs is even stronger in the case of costs. **If costs are ordered to be taxed at the end of a trial, which is frequently the case, a party appealing to the High Court will not know whether he can appeal as of right or only with leave of court in a case where the amount of damages awarded was less than $50,000. The answer will only be known after taxation and, if there is an application for review, only after review by the Registrar and the district judge in chambers.** This unhappy and confusing state of affairs does not even arise if we exclude costs from consideration when deciding whether a matter is appealable as of right under s 21 Supreme Court of Judicature Act.

(emphasis added)

24     Had the present case concerned the interpretation of Section 20 of SCA 1999, the application and adoption of the observations in _Abdul Rahman_ (at \[23\] above), albeit _obiter_, would have been relatively straight-forward. Indeed, the confusion and uncertainties associated with the Inclusive Interpretation as explained in _Abdul Rahman_ is itself a good reason militating against such interpretation, because it is a trite rule of statutory interpretation that the Parliament is presumed not to have intended an unworkable, impracticable or inconvenient result: _Hong Leong Bank Bhd v Soh Seow Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 525</span> at \[40\].

25     However, the matter is complicated because Section 20 of SCA 1999 was repealed in its entirety by the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Act 2010 (Act No 31 of 2010) which came into effect in January 2011 (the “**2011 Amendment Act**” or the “**2011 Amendments**”).

26     Pursuant to the 2011 Amendment Act, Section 19 of SCA 1999 was also amended to include provisions relating to the monetary jurisdiction of the District Court, and became what is substantially its current iteration in the SCA (with certain amendments made subsequently which are not relevant for the present purposes).

27     For ease of reference, I set out below a side-by-side comparison of the Section 21 of SCJA 1999, Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 and the current Section 19(4) of the SCA:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.3382921749479%"><col width="33.3234156501041%"><col width="33.3382921749479%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 21 of SCJA 1999</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 (Repealed)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 19(4) of SCA (Current)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other written law, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from a decision of a District Court or Magistrate’s Court in any suit or action for the recovery of immovable property or in any civil cause or matter where <b>the amount in dispute or the value of the subject matter</b> exceeds $50,000 or such other amount as may be specified by an order made under subsection (3) or with the leave of a District Court, a Magistrate’s Court or the High Court if under that amount.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">A District Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and try any action founded on contract or tort where —</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Subject to sections&nbsp;22 and 23, a District Court’s jurisdiction under subsection&nbsp;(2) does not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where&nbsp;—</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) the <b>debt, demand or damage claimed does not exceed the District Court limit</b>, whether on balance of account or otherwise; or</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) the <b>amount claimed in the action</b> exceeds the District Court limit; or</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) there is no claim for money, and the remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject-matter the value of which does not exceed the District Court limit.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) any remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

(emphasis added)

28     For completeness, I should add that Section 21 of SCJA 1999 was later amended and the current Section 21(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “**SCJA**”) makes it clear that the “_amount in dispute_” _excludes_ interest and costs:

> Subject to the provisions of this Act and any other written law, an appeal lies to the General Division from a decision of a District Court or Magistrate’s Court only with the permission of that District Court or Magistrate’s Court or the General Division in the following cases:

>> (a)    any case where the amount in dispute, or the value of the subject matter, at the hearing before that District Court or Magistrate’s Court **(excluding interest and costs)** does not exceed $60,000 or such other amount as may be specified by an order made under subsection (3);

>> (b)    any case specified in the Third Schedule.

(emphasis added)

29     Admittedly, the wording in the current Section 19(4) of the SCA differs from that in Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 (which was the provision referred to in _Abdul Rahman_). On this basis, the Defendant submitted that the Inclusive Interpretation should be adopted for Section 19(4) of the SCA, “_otherwise such a deliberate change by the legislature – which included a total repeal of section 20_ \[of SCA 1999\] _– would be meaningless_”.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

30     This submission is predicated on the assumption that the Parliament, in repealing Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 (and enacting corresponding amendments to Section 19 of SCA 1999) manifested an intention to prefer the Inclusive Interpretation. But is there basis to infer such legislative intent? In my view, the answer is no. In fact, when one considers the purpose behind the 2011 Amendments, it becomes even clearer that it is the Exclusive Interpretation that better accords with Parliament’s intention. I will explain.

#### The 2011 Amendment Act

31     As mentioned, Sections 19 and 20 of SCA 1999 were respectively amended and repealed pursuant to the 2011 Amendment Act. These amendments were made as part of a comprehensive review to rationalise the civil jurisdiction of the State Courts (then referred to as the Subordinate Courts). To be clear, the version of the Subordinate Courts Act which was amended by the 2011 Amendment Act was the 2007 Revised Edition, but the differences are not material for the present purposes and for convenience I will refer to these amendments as being made to SCA 1999 in this decision.

32     Prior to the 2011 Amendment Act, the civil jurisdiction of the District Court and the Magistrates’ Court was limited to claims in contract and tort, and only certain types of actions in equity: see Sections 20(1) and 26 of SCA 1999. Such subject-matter limitation on jurisdiction was thought to be unsatisfactory as it could “_be traps for the unwary_”: see _Supplementary Report in response to the Chief Justice’s Comments of the Committee to Review and Update the SCJA and SCA_ (January 2010) at \[14\]. Against this background (amongst others), legislative reviews were undertaken and the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 26 of 2010) (the “**SCA Amendment Bill**”) came to be tabled in Parliament in 2010.

33     At the second reading of the SCA Amendment Bill on 18 October 2010, then-Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee who moved the bill elaborated further on this: see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (18 October 2010) vol 87 at cols 1395–1398:

> Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a Second time.”

> Sir, as is the case for the amendments to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (SCJA), which I have just taken the House through, the last major review of the Subordinate Courts Act (SCA) was also in 1993. The amendments contained in this Bill also arose from the recommendations of the same two Reports which I had mentioned earlier.

> **Sir, the key amendment rationalises the civil jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts**. The remaining amendments are mainly housekeeping in nature, with some seeking to clarify existing judicial practice.

> Sir, on the rationalisation of civil jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts: **currently, the Act limits the types of cases which the Subordinate Courts can hear in two ways. First, by the value of the dispute** which is $250,000 for the District Court and $60,000 for the Magistrates’ Court and, second, by the legal nature of the dispute.

> **With respect to the legal nature of the dispute, currently, the District Court and Magistrates’ Court can only hear claims in contract and tort – what lawyers call "common law actions" – and certain types of actions in equity**. This means that the Subordinates Courts cannot hear restitution-type cases like money had and received, and equity-type actions like breach of fiduciary duties or actions for undue influence, even when the amount in dispute is within the Courts’ monetary limits. Sir, this is the case even though these types of actions are available in common law and equity. **There are also limits to the types of remedies they can grant**; for example, the Magistrates’ Court currently cannot grant injunctions.

> **Sir, these limits on the legal nature of the dispute create practical difficulties for litigants who are forced to go to the High Court when the actions can rightfully be commenced in the Subordinate Courts. It means higher costs for the litigants even though the value of their claim is within the Subordinate Courts’ monetary limits.**

> **Moreover, there is no reason why the cases that the Subordinate Courts can hear should be limited by what are essentially only technical differences in the legal nature of the dispute. Hence, clauses 2 and 14 of the Bill amend sections 19 and 22 to allow the District Court and the Magistrates’ Court to hear all types of actions and remedies, subject only to their respective monetary limits.** For the Magistrates’ Court, a further qualification is that the Magistrates’ Court will not have jurisdiction over claims which are exclusively non-monetary in nature such as a claim seeking delivery of goods.

> **Sir, with these amendments in place, a litigant who wishes to commence an action will no longer need to be concerned with the legal nature of his dispute when deciding in which Court – that is the High Court, District Court or Magistrates’ Court – to file his claim. Instead, the main determining factor would be the value of his claim. This is more straightforward and efficient**.

(emphasis added)

34     The 2011 Amendment Act was subsequently enacted pursuant to the SCA Amendment Bill passed by Parliament on 18th October 2010.

35     Three things are apparent from legislative history to the 2011 Amendment Act.

36     The first and most obvious one is that the repeal of Section 20 of SCA 1999 has _nothing_ to do with any intention on the part of the Parliament to prefer the Inclusive Interpretation. Such legislative intent is neither express nor manifest.

37     The second and related observation is that this legislative history _explains_ the _textual difference_ between Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 and the current Section 19(4) of the SCA.

38     For the present purposes, the main difference between these two provisions is that Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 refers to “_debt, demand or damage claimed_” whereas Section 19(4) of the SCA refers to “_amount claimed in the action_”. The latter is, on its face, of a wider import and therefore gives some credence to the argument that the Inclusive Interpretation should be preferred.

39     However, the legislative history shows that this difference is the result of the expansion of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the District Court and the Magistrates’ Court. The more restricted reference to “_debt, demand or damage_” appropriate for claims in tort and contract (and limited claims in equity) is no longer apt following the expansion of the courts’ subject-matter jurisdiction. This explains why the wider and more flexible term “_amount claimed_” is chosen instead.

40     The third observation is that the _general purpose_ of the 2011 Amendments is to make it more straightforward and easier for litigants to determine whether their claim(s) fall within or outside of the jurisdiction of the State Courts (be it the District Court or the Magistrates’ Court). Litigant no longer need to be concerned with the nature of their claim(s). Instead, “_the main determining factor would be the value of his claim_”. _Clarity and certainty_ are therefore the _express purposes_ of the 2011 Amendments.

41     It follows from the foregoing that the repeal of Section 20(1) of SCA 1999 was not _intended_ to detract from the Exclusive Interpretation suggested in _Abdul Rahman_. Rather, having regard to the intention of the Parliament to create jurisdictional markers for the District Court and the Magistrates’ Court which are _clearer_ and ascertainable with a _higher degree of certainty_ by the litigants, it is the Exclusive Interpretation which better promotes the _purpose or object_ of Section 19(4) of the SCA: see _Law Society of Singapore v Dhanwant Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 736</span> at \[77\].

#### Summary

42     Based on the text of the statute, the legislative framework, the legislative purpose and the relevant case authority, I am of the view that the interpretation of Section 19(4) of the SCA to be preferred is the Exclusive Interpretation. _In other words, the $250,000 monetary jurisdictional limit of the District Court as prescribed under Section 19(4) read with Section 2 of the SCA does not include elements of non-contractual interests and costs._ I see no reason why the same should not apply in relation to Sections 52(1A)(c) and (d) of the SCA in relation to the monetary jurisdictional limit of the Magistrates’ Court, although that issue strictly does not arise before me.

43     This conclusion I have arrived at is also consistent with the decision in _SCK Serijadi Sdn Bhd v Artison Interior Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 178</span> (“**_SCK Serijadi_**”) where the learned District Judge awarded pre-judgment interest and costs _in addition_ to a judgment sum at the highest end of the jurisdictional limit of the District Court (i.e. $250,000): see _SCK Serijadi_ at \[125\] and \[126\]. That said, the specific issue on whether the DC Monetary Limit included or excluded interest and costs was not argued or discussed in _SCK Serijadi_, so I go no further than to note the observation made here.

44     Before leaving this issue I should add that Suit 1224 is a tortious claim and there is no claim for _contractual_ interest in this action. This is the context in which my decision on the interpretation of Section 19(4) of the SCA should be understood.

### Issue 2 – Quantum

45     Having decided that I am not prohibited by Section 19(4) of the SCA from awarding interest and costs to the Plaintiff on top of a monetary award of $250,000, I next turn to consider the issue of quantum of cost and calculation of interest.

#### Interest

46     On the calculation of interest, parties are in general agreement that:

> (a)     no pre-judgment interest should be awarded for future losses (i.e. future expenses, loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity);[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> (b)     pre-judgment interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum should apply to general damages for pain and suffering (at 85%) from the date of the writ to the date of judgment, less any interim payment made;[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (c)     interest at the rate of 2.67% per annum should apply to special damages (at 85%) from the date of the accident to the date of judgment, less any interim payment made;[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) and

> (d)     the Plaintiff has received one interim payment of $50,000 on 28 February 2021 and another interim payment of $50,000 on 15 March 2021.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

47     In the circumstances, I make the following orders:

> (a)     Pre-judgment interest at the rate of 2.67% per annum is to run on the sum of $46,870.34 from 2 May 2018 to 28 February 2021.

> (b)     Pre-judgment interest at the rate of 2.67% per annum is to run on the sum of $85 from the date of the accident (i.e. 1 April 2017) to 28 February 2021.

> (c)     Pre-judgment interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum is to run on the sum of $52,105 from the date of the writ (i.e. 24 April 2019) to 28 February 2021.

48     I will explain the reasons for these orders.

49     The general basis for an award of pre-judgment interest is to compensate the claimant for having been kept out of monies to which he or she is later found to be entitled: see _Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd v Bank of India_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1308</span> at \[137\] and \[138\].

50     Consistent with this principle, in situations where interim payment(s) had been made prior to judgment, these payments should generally be taken into account to stop the running of pre-judgment interest. Two points should be noted in this regard.

> (a)     First, as a matter of law, interim payment(s) made prior to judgment should first be applied towards reducing general damages unless parties had agreed otherwise: see _Muhammad Adam bin Mohammad Lee (suing by his litigation representatives Noraini bte Tabiin and Nurul Ashikin binte Muhammad Lee) v Tay Jia Rong Sean_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 264</span> at \[317\] – \[320\]; _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth v Yeo Chye Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1106</span> at \[120\]. In this case, parties did not agree for the interim payments to be applied in any particular manner at the time of their payments.[^19] However, parties subsequently agreed (by submissions) that the interim payments should first be applied to special damages.[^20] In view of parties’ agreement, I will proceed on that basis.

> (b)     In this case, although the interim payments were made in two tranches on 28 February 2021 and 15 March 2021, the Plaintiff sensibly agreed that for ease of interest calculation, 28 February 2021 may be taken as the date on which interim payment of $100,000 was made.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

51     In this case, the total amount assessed as special damages (pre-trial) is $114,879.58 (at 100%). At the agreed apportionment of 85%, the sum is $97,647.64. Of these:

> (a)     $50,692.30 (at 85%) is for medical expenses;

> (b)     $46,870.34 (at 85%) is for loss of earnings; and

> (c)     $85 (at 85%) is for transport expenses.

52     For the medical expenses of $50,692.30 (at 85%), I am if the view that the Plaintiff is not entitled to any pre-judgment interest. This is because these medical expenses were paid by the Plaintiff’s former employer, Sheng Yi Construction Pte Ltd (“**Sheng Yi**”), and not the Plaintiff. The amount is awarded to the Plaintiff pursuant to the rule set down in _Minichit Bunhom v Jazali bin Kastari and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 1037</span> (“**_Minichit_**”), coupled with a direction that the recovered medical expenses of $50,692.30 be returned by the Plaintiff to Sheng Yi: see _Minichit_ at \[83\] and \[85\]. It is the Plaintiff’s own evidence that these medical expenses were paid by Sheng Yi from the outset.[^22] Accordingly, the Plaintiff was never put out of funds for this sum of $50,692.30. There is also no suggestion that Sheng Yi was claiming interest on this amount or that the Plaintiff was otherwise liable to Sheng Yi for interest on the medical expenses. There is therefore no basis to award the Plaintiff pre-judgment interest on this sum.

53     For the Plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earnings, interest should run at the rate of 2.67% per annum, as parties have agreed. This is the usual rate for pre-judgment interest on special damages. However, in this case it would not be fair for interest to start running from the date of the accident (i.e. 1 April 2017). This is because the Plaintiff remained in employment until 2 May 2018 and was paid his wages and/or medical leave wages up to 1 May 2018.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) The Plaintiff therefore suffered no loss of earning in the period between 1 April 2017 to 1 May 2018. Interest on this amount (i.e. $46,870.34) should therefore only start running on 2 May 2018. Such pre-judgment interest stops running on 28 February 2021, when the interim payment was made.

54     Lastly, for transport expenses, interest is to run on the sum of $85 (at 85%) at the rate of 2.67% per annum from the date of the accident (i.e. 1 April 2017) to 28 February 2021.

55     After deducting the sum of $46,955.34 (i.e. $46,870.34 + $85) from the interim payment amount, the balance remaining is $53,044.66 (i.e. $100,000 – $46,955.34) . This is then applied to reducing pre-judgment interest payable on the general damages assessed, to which I now turn.

56     In this case, the total amount assessed as general damages for the Plaintiff’s pain and suffering (pre-trial) is $61,300 (at 100%). At the agreed apportionment of 85%, the sum is $52,105. The Plaintiff is therefore entitled to pre-judgment interest at the agreed rate of 5.33% on the sum of $52,105. Interest on this sum should start running from the date of the filing of the writ (as agreed between the parties) and it should stop running on 28 February 2021 when the interim payment was made.

57     To be clear, the Plaintiff is not entitled to pre-judgment interest on any award for loss of future earnings, loss or earning capacity or future medical expenses. Not only is this the position agreed between parties, it is also consistent with authority: see _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> at \[151\].

#### Costs

58     Having considered parties’ submissions, I allow the Plaintiff $18,500 plus GST as costs, and reasonable disbursements to be agreed between the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, taxed by the court.

59     In arriving at this award on costs I considered the following:

> (a)     Interlocutory judgment on liability was entered by consent.

> (b)     Although the final award is at the highest end of the District Court limit, a substantial portion was agreed between the parties and not contested.

> (c)     The Plaintiff made a number of inconsistent and overlapping claims variously in his pleadings, opening statement and closing submissions which were only clarified upon the court’s directions. This resulted in unnecessary delay and wasted costs.

> (d)     The AD Proceedings only took two half-day tranches before me, in large part because the Defendant agreed to dispense with the attendance of the expert witnesses.

## Conclusion

60     In summary, my decision on the issue of pre-judgment interest and costs is as follows:

> (a)     The monetary jurisdictional limit of the District Court under Section 19(4) of the SCA does _not_ include non-contractual interests and costs;

> (b)     The Plaintiff is entitled to:

>> (i)       pre-judgment interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum on the sum of $52,105 from the date of the writ (i.e. 24 April 2019) to 28 February 2021;

>> (ii)       pre-judgment interest at the rate of 2.67% per annum on the sum of $46,870.34 from 2 May 2018 to 28 February 2021; and

>> (iii)       pre-judgment interest at the rate of 2.67% per annum on the sum of $85 from the date of the accident (i.e. 1 April 2017) to 28 February 2021; and

> (c)     The Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff costs of Suit 1224 fixed at $18,500 plus GST. The Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff’s reasonable disbursements, with the quantum to be taxed if not agreed.

61     I thank counsels for their assistance in this matter.
