Civil Procedure – Summary judgment – Whether there was an issue that ought to be tried or whether there ought for some other reason to be a trial – Order 14 r 3 Rules of Court 2014

Tort – Conversion – Whether items were abandoned

31 October 2022

### District Judge Jill Tan Li Ching:

## Introduction

1       This suit was a claim in conversion. The subject matter of the claim consisted of items (“**the Items**”) that the plaintiff won in two auctions that were held by the Sheriff of the Supreme Court (“**Sheriff**”) under Writ of Seizure and Sale HC/WSS 35/2020. The judgment creditor in that case was a company named Des-Wood Pte Ltd (“**Des-Wood**”), and the judgment debtor was Sapporo Japanese Restaurant Pte Ltd (“**Sapporo**”).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

2       The Items were physically situated in two locations occupied by restaurants, and they included bottles of alcohol, kitchen appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, furniture such as tables, chairs and lights, tableware such as cutlery and crockery, and air-conditioning units.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) The first location was occupied by Minato Dining Pte Ltd (“**Minato**”), at AXA Tower at 8 Shenton Way #01-17/20 (“**the AXA premises**”). The second was occupied by Niwa Dining Pte Ltd (“**Niwa**”), at 3 Yuan Ching Road #01-02A (“**the Yuan Ching premises**”). The Defendant was the director of Sapporo, Minato and Niwa at all material times.

3       The auction for the items at the AXA premises took place on 1 September 2021, while the auction for the items at the Yuan Ching premises took place on 2 September 2021. Despite some communications between parties, they were unable to agree on the time and manner of the plaintiff’s collection of the Items.

4       The plaintiff filed the present suit in January 2022 for, _inter alia_, delivery of the Items or damages to be assessed. It was revealed in June 2022, through the defendant’s answers to interrogatories, that all the items bar three air-conditioning units (“**items #38 and #41**” or “**the air-con units**”) in the Yuan Ching premises had been disposed of on or about 13 September 2021, while all the items in the AXA premises had been disposed of on or about 27 November 2021.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

5       The plaintiff thereafter filed an application for summary judgment. The Deputy Registrar (“**DR**”) entered summary judgment in the plaintiff’s favour for damages to be assessed in respect of all the Items disposed of, with costs reserved to the registrar assessing the damages. No orders were made in respect of the air-con units that had yet to be disposed of. The defendant filed a Registrar’s Appeal (“**RA**”) against this decision, seeking unconditional leave to defend, and also sought leave to admit further evidence in support of the appeal. I dismissed the appeal, and these are the grounds of my decision.

## Issues to be Determined

6       The preliminary issue to be determined was whether to allow the admission of the further evidence in the appeal.

7       The primary issue was whether there was an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried, or that there ought for some other reason to be a trial, such that the summary judgment should be set aside, and leave granted to defend the action.

## Preliminary Issue: Whether the further evidence should be admitted

### Law

8       The preliminary issue was straightforward, and the applicable law was not controversial. Since a judge hearing an RA on a summary judgment hears the matter afresh, that judge is free to allow the admission of fresh evidence in the absence of contrary reasons. Thus, the _“Ladd v Marshall”_ conditions strictly do not apply – see _Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1053</span> at \[38\].

9       The further evidence which the defendant sought to admit consisted of two emails, one letter, and documents concerning a claim filed in the Small Claims Tribunals (“**SCT**”).[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) The plaintiff did not object to the admission of this evidence. The emails were from the defendant to the plaintiff, asking the latter to remove the Items from the premises, while the letter was from the landlord of the AXA premises stating when the lease was ending. The SCT documents concerned a claim filed by the plaintiff against Sapporo for the delivery of the items won at the auction at the Yuan Ching premises (“**the SCT claim**”). Sapporo, represented by the defendant at the SCT, contended that the action should have been filed against the Supreme Court of Singapore or the Sheriff instead. The plaintiff withdrew the claim on or about 23 November 2021.

### Analysis

10     Although the _Ladd v Marshall_ conditions did not strictly apply in the present case, I nevertheless had regard to them as a frame of reference. Thus, in terms of availability, the evidence was clearly available at the time the Defence was filed, and should have been submitted earlier. In terms of credibility or authenticity of the evidence, there was no dispute as to this.

11     Counsel for the defendant/appellant Mr Lam Wai Seng submitted that the evidence was relevant, and would support the defendant’s position. Counsel for the plaintiff/respondent Mr Ang Woon Kherk took the view that the evidence was relevant, but did not affect the outcome of the case.

12     My view was that the evidence was relevant as the emails and the letter supported the defendant’s case, while the SCT documents supported the plaintiff’s case. Although they might not be decisive of the parties’ cases and should have been submitted earlier, I determined that allowing their admission into evidence would give the court a fuller picture of what had transpired between parties. I therefore admitted this further evidence and considered it in arriving at my decision.

## Primary Issue: Whether there was an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried, or whether there ought for some other reason to be a trial

### Law

13     On the primary or substantive issue, the applicable law was not disputed.

14     In an application for summary judgment, where the plaintiff has shown that there is a _prima facie_ case for judgment, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a _bona fide_ defence to obtain leave to defend – see _M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 325</span> (“**_M2B World Asia Pacific_**”) at \[17\]. Where the court is satisfied not only that there is no defence, but that there is no fairly arguable point to be argued on behalf of the defendant, it is the court’s duty to give judgment for the plaintiff – _Stone Forest Consulting Pte Ltd v Wee Poh Holdings Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 216</span> at \[18\], citing _Anglo-Italian Bank v Wells (and Davies_) (1878) 38 LT 197 at 201.

15     O 14 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court 2014 states that a court may grant summary judgment to the plaintiff unless the defendant satisfies the court that there is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried, or that there ought for some other reason to be a trial. It has been held that the latter limb can be invoked where a court is satisfied that there are circumstances that ought to be investigated, even though the defendant cannot point to a specific issue which ought to be tried. As noted by the High Court in _Concentrate Engineering Pte Ltd v United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 1 SLR(R) 465</span> at \[12\], citing Megarry J in _Miles v Bull_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 1 QB 258</span>, “Order 14 is for the plain and straightforward, not for the devious and crafty.” However, where it is clear that there is no defence, the fact that the court disapproves of the general behaviour of the plaintiff or parties is not a reason to deny summary judgment – see _Ling Yew Kong v Teo Vin Li Richard_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 123</span> at \[33\].

16     Next, to sustain a claim in conversion, the plaintiff has to prove three elements. First, that he had actual possession of, or the right to immediate possession of, the chattel converted. Second, the plaintiff must show that the right to sue for conversion existed at the time of the conversion. Third, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff’s superior possessory title – see _Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and others v McTrans Cargo (S) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 250</span> at \[44\].

### Analysis

17     The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff had the right to immediate possession of the Items won at the auctions, and that he had a right to sue for conversion at the time the Items were disposed of. The Defendant therefore accepted that the first two elements in the legal test for conversion were satisfied.

18     The defendant also admitted that all the Items (except for the air-con units) had been disposed of. It was thus clear that the plaintiff had shown that there was a _prima facie_ case for summary judgment. The burden then fell to the defendant to show that she had a _bona fide_ defence.

19     In this regard, Mr Lam raised three main arguments – abandonment, the plaintiff’s lack of _bona fides_, and whether the defendant was the correct party to sue. I dealt with the first two points together, followed by the third.

##### _Abandonment and lack of_ bona fides

20     During the RA, Mr Lam contended that the third element to prove conversion was not made out: that is, the defendant had not acted in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff’s superior possessory title, because the plaintiff had effectively **abandoned** the Items.

21     I noted that abandonment was not pleaded in the Defence. At best, it was alluded to in the assertion[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) that the plaintiff had been given the opportunity to collect and remove the Items, but failed to do so. However, the thrust of the pleaded Defence seemed to be the unreasonableness of the plaintiff’s conduct, and that he had not been a _bona fide_ purchaser of the Items, only purchasing them to harass and cause disruption to the businesses of Minato and Niwa.[^6] It appeared that it was only after the DR mentioned abandonment in his Grounds of Decision (“**DR’s GD**”)[^7] that this point was substantively taken up by the defendant.

22     If abandonment was in fact the defence,[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) then since the Items (except for the air-con units) had been disposed of, it did not appear on the present facts that it was tenable for the defendant to accept that the second element of the test for conversion had been satisfied, but also claim that the third was not. This was because if the plaintiff had the right to sue in conversion for the Items at the time they were disposed of, then it must be that by disposing of them, the defendant had acted in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff’s superior possessory title.[^9] This clearly meant that conversion was made out, and this was sufficient to dispose of the argument based on abandonment. However, since the defendant contended that there were “major factual disputes” surrounding why the plaintiff did not collect the Items which were relevant to the defence, I considered these points for completeness.

23     In summary, the arguments before me on appeal were that the defendant had given the plaintiff every reasonable opportunity to collect the Items, but the plaintiff did not take these opportunities. Thus, he had effectively abandoned the goods and she could not be held responsible for disposing of them. The plaintiff’s case was that he repeatedly asserted his rights to the Items, and thus could not be said to have abandoned them. As for his failure to collect the Items from the premises, his case was that it was not for want of trying, but he was prevented from doing so by numerous conditions laid down by the defendant, which he regarded as unreasonable. He maintained that the various allegations raised by the defendant did not detract from the fact that he was the rightful owner of the Items, which had been substantially disposed of.

24     In this regard, I noted the timeline of the main events.

> (a)     1 September 2021:

>> The first auction was held at the AXA premises. The plaintiff stated that after he won the auction, he wanted some movers whom he had hired to enter the premises to remove those items.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) However, they were prevented from doing so as the defendant claimed that the Plaintiff needed to submit a permit to work. The defendant then proceeded to lock the AXA premises and attend another auction. Later that day, the defendant requested that the plaintiff confirmed a schedule for collecting the said items, but the plaintiff responded that he would collect them whenever he wanted. [^11]

> (b)     2 September 2021:

>> (i)       The second auction was held at the Yuan Ching premises. As with the first auction, the plaintiff brought movers there, and submitted their work permits for the defendant to make a copy of. However, when the movers entered the premises, they were prevented from removing those items, unless the plaintiff first signed a document. The Plaintiff declined to do so since he was the owner of the goods, and the movers were asked by the defendant to leave. The police were then called, but were unable to resolve the matter. The plaintiff and the movers thus left.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

>> (ii)       At 5:50 pm, the defendant sent the Plaintiff an email stating, _inter alia_, that the items at the AXA premises were to be collected between 10 pm on 11 September 2021 (Saturday), and 11:59 pm on 12 September 2021 (Sunday).[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

>> (iii)       At 6:14 pm, the defendant sent the plaintiff an email stating, _inter alia_, that the items at the Yuan Ching premises were to be collected between 8 pm and 11:59 pm on 5 September 2021 (Sunday).[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> (c)     3 September 2021:

>> (i)       At 1:17 pm, Mr Lam, acting for Minato, sent the plaintiff a letter by email, stating that the items at the AXA premises could be collected between 8 am and 11 pm on 5 September 2021 (Sunday).[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

>> (ii)       At 1:20 pm, Mr Lam, acting for Niwa, sent the plaintiff a letter by email, stating that the items at the Yuan Ching premises could be collected that same day (Friday) from 5 pm onwards, until 11 pm on 4 September 2021 (Saturday).[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

>> (iii)       At 5:57 pm, the Sheriff emailed both parties stating that they had agreed that all Items would be removed from:

>>> ·       the Yuan Ching premises between 11 pm on 6 September 2021 (Monday) and 6 am on 7 September 2021 (Tuesday); and

>>> ·       the AXA premises between 11 pm on 7 September 2021 (Tuesday) and 6 am on 8 September 2021 (Wednesday).

>> At 7:07 pm, the plaintiff replied to the Sheriff, stating, among other things, that items not belonging to him should be removed before his contractors’ arrival, and that a passageway should be cleared so that there was no obstruction when they removed the Items. The defendant replied at 7:32 pm that the plaintiff should remove the Items at his own cost, without touching any items belonging to the premises.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (d)     6 September 2021:

>> At 5:21 pm, the plaintiff informed the Sheriff by email that he would not be attending at the Yuan Ching premises for the removal because his contractors were concerned there would be another incident involving the police like the one on 2 September 2021. He also reiterated his request that items not belonging to him should be removed from the refrigerators and chillers.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (e)     7 September 2021:

>> At 10:25 am, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff on behalf of Niwa, attaching an invoice for the storage of his items at the Yuan Ching premises, with daily charges. He was asked to collect the items no later than 11 pm on 8 September 2021, failing which the said items would be disposed of and he would be “bill\[ed\] accordingly”.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) The plaintiff stated that he did not respond because he was unable to get movers on such short notice, and was being made to pay storage charges, which he did not want to inadvertently accept liability for.[^20] He also did not attend at the AXA premises to remove the items.

> (f)     13 September 2021:

>> The items at the Yuan Ching premises were disposed of, except for the air-con units

> (g)     1 & 4 October 2021:

>> On 1 October 2021, a debt collector contacted the defendant to inform her that he would be turning up at the Yuan Ching premises on 4 October 2021 to collect the items there. Debt collectors in fact turned up at the said premises at about 1:40 pm on 4 October 2021, but were unsuccessful at retrieving any items.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) No mention was made that the said items had already substantially been disposed of.

> (h)     8 October 2021:

>> At 9:12 pm, the defendant sent an email to the plaintiff on behalf of Minato, attaching invoices for $35,310 for storage charges for the items at the AXA premises, and asking him to settle the bill by 10 October 2021. The plaintiff was again asked to remove the items from the premises, failing which they would “dispose and claim against \[him\].”[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) He stated that he did not respond as he was trying to find a way to recover the items without having to pay the storage charges.[^23]

> (i)     3 November 2021:

>> The plaintiff filed the SCT claim against Sapporo for the delivery of the items won at the auction at the Yuan Ching premises. As noted above at \[9\], Sapporo, represented by the defendant, contended that it was not the correct party to be sued. No mention was made by the defendant that the items had already been substantially disposed of. The plaintiff withdrew the claim on or about 23 November 2021, on the ground that he needed more time to consider his next course of action.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

> (j)     27 November 2021:

>> The items at the AXA premises were disposed of.

25     Even taking this evidence on its face, it was clear that both parties’ conduct was less than ideal throughout this period. It could be asked why the plaintiff did not make more efforts to find suitable time slots to collect the Items or why he did not respond to the defendant’s correspondence. However, the defendant undeniably did not make it easy for the plaintiff. For example, the dates and time slots set for the plaintiff to collect the Items kept changing, such that within about 24 hours (from 5:50 pm on 2 September 2021 to 5:57 pm on 3 September 2021), three sets of dates and time slots were given (see \[24(b)\] and \[24(c)\]). The timelines set out in Mr Lam’s letters of 3 September 2021 were also not reasonable given that it was the weekend, and neither were the timings to collect the Items. Even when the dates were shifted in the email from the Sheriff, the timings involved conducting the removals in the dead of night. The defendant also declined to remove items from the refrigerators and freezers which did not belong to the plaintiff, while requiring the plaintiff not to touch anything belonging to the premises – this was clearly unworkable.

26     It might also be asked why the plaintiff did not make further demands for the Items after 7 September 2021. However, given that not even a week had passed when the items at the Yuan Ching premises were substantially disposed of on 13 September 2021, it was surely too soon for the defendant to think that the plaintiff had abandoned the Items. Further, the plaintiff did seek to recover the items from the Yuan Ching premises in early October 2021 through the debt collectors, and in early November 2021 through the SCT claim. Putting aside the odd fact that the defendant did not see fit to inform the plaintiff that the items from the Yuan Ching premises had already been substantially disposed of, these attempts at recovery clearly showed that the plaintiff had not abandoned the items at the Yuan Ching premises, and was likely to still be interested in the items at the AXA premises as well. The fact that the plaintiff withdrew the SCT claim with the express statement that he wished to consider his further causes of action was also clearly not an indication of abandonment, so the items in the AXA premises should not have been disposed of a mere four days later.

27     The defendant contended that her emails of 7 September 2021 and 8 October 2021 to the plaintiff gave him notice of the impending disposal of the Items if he did not collect them. Thus, since he did not respond to those emails, the defendant was entitled to dispose of them. However, these notices contained demands for payment of storage charges, when it was not established that the defendant, Minato or Niwa were entitled to impose such charges on the owner of the goods. There was also no evidence that the defendant took further steps to claim these storage charges from the plaintiff after disposing of the Items, rendering those demands questionable. Given that the defendant had made demands of questionable validity, she could not rely on this as the basis to sustain a belief that the plaintiff’s lack of response amounted to an abandonment of the Items.

28     On the above facts, I was unable to find any _bona fide_ defence that the defendant could raise based on abandonment.

29     I then considered the defendant’s numerous assertions concerning the plaintiff’s alleged lack of _bona fides_, and his lack of credibility as a witness. These centered around the defendant’s bare assertion that the plaintiff was working with the director of Des-Wood to “take revenge” on Sapporo because Des-Wood had not been able to recover its debt from Sapporo. The defendant asserted that it could be inferred that the plaintiff’s intent in bidding for the Items at the auctions was only to use them as a tool to harass, disrupt, obstruct and/or inconvenience the businesses of Minato and Niwa.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) The defendant also pointed out that the plaintiff’s claim that he did not know the defendant was untrue, since they had exchanged WhatsApp messages previously.

30     I did not find that this line of argument assisted the defendant, for a few reasons.

> (a)     First, these claims concerning the plaintiff’s reasons for bidding for the Items were bare assertions, and could not form the basis for a defence – see _M2B World Asia Pacific_ at \[19\].

> (b)     Second, they were speculative and irrational – for if it were true that Des-Wood wanted to take revenge on Sapporo for an unpaid debt, it did not make sense to do so by expending even more money by bidding for items at the auction with no intention of collecting or using them. Put another way, it would be “throwing good money after bad”.

> (c)     Third, regardless of the plaintiff’s reasons for bidding for the Items, it was not denied that he won the auctions and had good legal title to the Items. The defendant’s repeated assertions that the plaintiff had not acted in a _bona fide_ manner and that the plaintiff had not come with clean hands was beside the point – this action was in the tort of conversion and not based in equity.

> (d)     Fourth, concerning the plaintiff’s alleged lack of truthfulness about whether he knew the defendant, this did not affect his legal title to the Items. It also did not change the fact that they had been substantially disposed of under the defendant’s watch, when it was not clear that the plaintiff had abandoned them.

31     It was in this vein that Mr Lam submitted[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) that there were numerous triable issues of law and fact in this case. The issues of law revolved around the questions of what the scope of duty of an execution debtor was to a successful bidder at an enforcement auction when the successful bidder did not collect and remove the items sold despite several opportunities given to him to do so; what the parallel scope of duty was for the occupier of the premises in which the said items resided; and what remedies these parties had. The issues of fact concerned whether there was abandonment, whether the Plaintiff had acted reasonably, and whether the Plaintiff was a witness of truth.

32     The said issues of law were simply alternative ways of phrasing the question of whether the defendant could sustain a _bona fide_ defence of abandonment. For the reasons set out above, my view was that she could not. As for the said issues of fact, I agreed with the DR that the mere existence of disputed facts did not automatically mean that there was a triable issue, for it must also be relevant to a legal defence – see DR’s GD at \[30\], citing _Lim Beng Yaw Admen v GT Dollar Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 39</span> at \[34\]. For the reasons set out above, my view was that the disputes of fact did not amount to triable issues as they did not give rise to a valid defence for the defendant.

33     Ultimately, I was unable to find that there was a specific issue to be tried, or that there ought for some other reason to be a trial. In this regard, I did not find the plaintiff’s conduct to be so “devious and crafty” that it called for investigation in a trial. Although my view was that the plaintiff’s conduct left something to be desired, as noted in case law, this did not mean that he should be denied summary judgment where appropriate.

#### Wrong party to be sued

34     Finally, I considered the third main point raised by Mr Lam, on whether the defendant was the correct party to be sued. In her affidavit filed in support of the request for the further evidence to be submitted for the RA, the defendant contended that she was not the correct party to be sued as she had no part to play in the seizure of the items or the conduct of the auction. She also contended that she, on the instructions of the Sheriff, was acting as Sapporo’s representative at all material times. Thus, it was Sapporo that should have been sued, instead of her.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

35     As with the point on abandonment, this was not pleaded in the Defence. No application had been made to amend the Defence, and I noted that the defendant’s submission on what the triable issues were did not include this point. As noted above, in the SCT claim, Sapporo, represented by the defendant, had contended that it was the wrong party to sue. It was thus extremely unlikely that the defendant would have missed asserting in her Defence to this suit a contention that she was not the right party to be sued if she genuinely believed this to be so. This contention thus appeared to be an afterthought, included to bolster the case for leave to defend.

36     More crucially, in the SCT claim, the defendant had contended that Sapporo should not have been sued, and that the Supreme Court or the Sheriff should instead have been named as respondents. Now that the defendant had been personally sued, she was contending that Sapporo should be sued – which was exactly what the plaintiff did in the SCT, but which the defendant claimed was wrong. This “flip-flopping” by the defendant was highly suggestive that she would raise any convenient argument to evade liability, which did not aid her cause at all.

37     In any event, although the Items were physically in premises occupied by Minato and Niwa, the defendant was the director of the companies at all material times. There was no suggestion that there was some other decision-making authority that determined when and how the Items were disposed of, or that she had no control over the disposal of the Items. The defendant was the one in communication with the plaintiff and the Sheriff at all material times in relation to the Items, and it was clear that the Items could not have been disposed of without her consent. It was thus clear that if the Items were dealt with in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff’s rights, the defendant was responsible of these acts and thus a proper party to sue – see _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore (2017 Reissue), Volume 18_ at \[240.554\].

38     In all, I was also unable to see how this final point raised a _bona fide_ defence.

## Conclusion

39     In conclusion, I affirmed the DR’s decision to grant summary judgment in favour of the plaintiff for damages to be assessed in respect of the Items disposed of (that is, all Items except for items #38 and #41 from the Yuan Ching premises), and to make no orders in respect of the said items #38 and #41. I also affirmed his order on costs. The appeal was therefore dismissed.

40     Having heard parties on the costs of the RA, I noted that each party filed one affidavit, and the substantive hearing took just over an hour. Although a fair amount of facts needed to be digested due to the nature of the defence mounted, the legal issues were not complex. I therefore awarded fixed costs of $5,000 (all in) to the plaintiff.
